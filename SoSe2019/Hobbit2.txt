1
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,567
I'm dying of thirst over here.
Come on! Come on!

2
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,124
- Here you are.
- Thank you kindly.

3
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,561
- Oh, watch it!
- Sorry, darling.

4
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,161
- There you are.
- Thank you.

5
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,850
Master Stadle.

6
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,370
Mind if I join you?

7
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,330
I'll have the same.

8
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,691
I should introduce myself.
My name is Gandalf.

9
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,406
Gandalf the Grey.

10
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,644
I know who you are.

11
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,163
Well, now. This is a fine chance.

12
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,046
What brings Thorin Oakenshield to Bree?

13
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,570
I received word that my father...

14
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,568
had been seen wandering
the Wilds near Dunland.

15
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,485
I went looking.

16
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,731
I found no sign of him.

17
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,329
Thrain.

18
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,202
You're like the others.

19
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,811
You think he is dead.

20
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,567
I was not at the Battle of Moria.

21
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,404
No...

22
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,408
but I was.

23
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,325
<i>My grandfather...</i>

24
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,522
<i>Thror, was slain.</i>

25
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,942
No!

26
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,803
- Father.
- Stay back!

27
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,530
No. I will fight with you!

28
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,167
Azog means to kill us all.

29
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,646
One by one, he will destroy the line of Durin.

30
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,441
But by mine's life,
he shall not take my son.

31
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,960
You will stay here.

32
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,965
<i>My father led a charge
towards the Dimrill Gate.</i>

33
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,062
<i>He never returned.</i>

34
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,302
Father!

35
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,968
<i>"Thrain is gone," they told me.</i>

36
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,646
<i>"He is one of the fallen."</i>

37
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,001
<i>But at the end of that battle,
I searched amongst the slain.</i>

38
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,402
<i>To the last body.</i>

39
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,887
My father was not among the dead.

40
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,328
Thorin, it's been a long time since anything
but rumor was heard of Thrain.

41
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,765
He still lives. I am sure of it.

42
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,828
The ring your grandfather wore...

43
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:08,786
one of the seven given to
the Dwarf-lords many years ago...

44
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,403
What became of it?

45
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,962
He gave it to my father
before they went into battle.

46
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,044
So Thrain was wearing it when he...

47
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,681
When he went missing.

48
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,120
- That's that, then.
- There you are.

49
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,960
I know my father came to see you
before the Battle of Moria.

50
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,651
What did you say to him?

51
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,403
I urged him to march upon Erebor, to rally
the seven armies of the Dwarves...

52
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,450
to destroy the dragon and take
back the Lonely Mountain.

53
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,603
And I would say the same to you.

54
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,846
Take back your homeland.

55
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,849
This is no chance meeting, is it, Gandalf?

56
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,041
No.

57
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,331
It is not.

58
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,918
The Lonely Mountain troubles me, Thorin.

59
00:06:04,922 --> 00:06:07,106
That dragon has sat there long enough.

60
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,764
Sooner or later darker minds
will turn towards Erebor.

61
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,287
I ran into some unsavory characters
whilst traveling on the Greenway.

62
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,291
They mistook me for a Vagabond.

63
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,766
I imagine they regretted that.

64
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,446
One of them was carrying a message.

65
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,250
It is Black Speech.

66
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,170
A promise of payment.

67
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,601
For what?

68
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,487
Your head.

69
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,643
Someone wants you dead.

70
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,044
Thorin, you can wait no longer.
You are the heir to the Throne of Durin.

71
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,729
Unite the armies of the Dwarves.

72
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,243
Together, you have the might
and power to retake Erebor.

73
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,762
Summon a meeting of the seven Dwarf families.

74
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,729
Demand they stand by their oath.

75
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,891
The seven armies swore that oath
to the one who wields the King's Jewel.

76
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,167
The Arkenstone.

77
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,022
It is the only thing that will unite them...

78
00:07:08,048 --> 00:07:11,197
and in case you have forgotten
that jewel was stolen by Smaug.

79
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,245
What if I were to help you reclaim it?

80
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,047
How?

81
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:27,286
The Arkenstone lies half a world away buried
beneath the feet of a fire-breathing dragon.

82
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,481
Yes, it does.

83
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,406
Which is why we're going to need a burglar.

84
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,440
How close is the pack?

85
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,121
Too close. A couple of leagues, no more.
But that's not the worst of it.

86
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,840
- Have the Wargs picked up our scent?
- Not yet. But they will do.

87
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,441
- We have another problem.
- Did they see you?

88
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,240
- They saw you.
- No, that's not it.

89
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,091
What did I tell you?
Quiet as a mouse.

90
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,366
Excellent burglar material.

91
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,241
Will you listen? Will you just listen?

92
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,720
I'm trying to tell you
there is something else out there.

93
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,161
What form did it take?

94
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,881
Like a bear?

95
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,121
Yes, but bigger.
Much bigger.

96
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,206
You knew about this beast?

97
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,602
- I say we double back.
- And be run down by a pack of Orcs?

98
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:21,291
There is a house. It's not far
from here, where we might take refuge.

99
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,760
Whose house?

100
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,246
Are they friend or foe?

101
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,771
Neither.

102
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,728
He will help us or...

103
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,885
he will kill us.

104
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,364
What choice do we have?

105
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,081
None.

106
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,850
Come on!

107
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,929
This way! Quickly!

108
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,203
Run!

109
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,765
Bombur, come on!

110
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,050
To the house!

111
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,641
Run!

112
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,485
Come on, get inside.

113
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,201
Open the door!

114
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,606
Quickly!

115
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,643
- Push!
- Push!

116
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,580
Come on, lads!

117
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:01,882
What is that?

118
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,444
That is our host.

119
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,202
His name is Beorn.

120
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,607
And he's a skin-changer.

121
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,001
Sometimes he's a huge black bear.
Sometimes he's a great strong man.

122
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,362
The bear is unpredictable...

123
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,573
but the man can be reasoned with.
However...

124
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:30,014
he is not overfond of Dwarves.

125
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,440
He's leaving.

126
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,648
Come away from there.

127
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,366
It's not natural. None of it.

128
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,762
It's obvious.
He's under some dark spell.

129
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,001
Don't be a fool.

130
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,641
He's under no enchantment but his own.

131
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,090
All right, now get some sleep. All of you.

132
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,687
You'll be safe here tonight.

133
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,529
I hope.

134
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,001
Don't blame me!

135
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,691
Come on, Dori!

136
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,606
Well, I say we should leg it.
Slip out the back way.

137
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,850
I'm not running from anyone, beast or no.

138
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,411
There is no point in arguing.

139
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,800
We cannot pass through the Wilderland
without Beorn's help.

140
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,889
We'll be hunted down,
before we ever get to the forest.

141
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,362
Ah, Bilbo.
There you are.

142
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,490
Now, this will require some delicate handling.

143
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,768
We must tread very carefully.

144
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,005
The last person to have startled
him was torn to shreds.

145
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,609
I will go first and... Bilbo?
You come with me.

146
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,486
- Is this a good idea?
- Yes.

147
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,777
Now, the rest of you, you just wait here
and don't come out until I give the signal.

148
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:13,302
Right, wait for the signal.

149
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,842
And no sudden moves or loud noises,
and don't overcrowd him.

150
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,401
And only come out in pairs. Right.

151
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:24,842
No, actually, Bombur. You count
as two so you should come out alone.

152
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,926
Remember, wait for the signal.

153
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,845
The signal. Right.

154
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,120
What signal would that be?

155
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,400
You're nervous.

156
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,889
Nervous? What nonsense.

157
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,382
Good morning.

158
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,689
Good morning!

159
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,965
Who are you?

160
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,000
I'm Gandalf. Gandalf the Grey.

161
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,729
Never heard of him.

162
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,041
I'm a Wizard.

163
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,165
Perhaps you've heard of my colleague
Radagast the Brown.

164
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,404
He resides in the southern
borders of Mirkwood.

165
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,768
What do you want?

166
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,561
Well, simply to thank you
for your hospitality.

167
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,484
You may have noticed that we took refuge
in your lodgings here last night.

168
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,680
Who is this little fellow?

169
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,607
Well, this would be Mr. Baggins...

170
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,887
from the Shire.

171
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,281
He's not a Dwarf, is he?

172
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,650
Why, no. No, he's a Hobbit.

173
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,801
A good family and unimpeachable reputation.

174
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,442
A Halfling and a Wizard.

175
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,600
How come you here?

176
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,001
Oh, well, the fact is that we've had
a bad time of it...

177
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,084
from Goblins in the mountains.

178
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,450
What did you go near Goblins for?
Stupid thing to do.

179
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,926
You are absolutely...

180
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,767
- right. No, it was terrible.
- There it is. Go.

181
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,727
Dwalin and Balin.

182
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:42,422
And I must confess that, several
of our group are, in fact, Dwarves.

183
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,567
Do you call two...

184
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,041
"several"?

185
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,032
Well, now you put it that way.

186
00:19:53,229 --> 00:19:55,647
Yes, there could be more than two.

187
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,540
Wait, that's us.

188
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,284
Oh, and here are some more
of our happy troop.

189
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,727
And do you call six a "troop"?

190
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,201
What are you, a traveling circus?

191
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,048
Go.

192
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,361
Go. Go, go.

193
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,087
Dori and Ori at your service.

194
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,000
I don't want your service.

195
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,480
Absolutely understandable.

196
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,403
Go.

197
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,640
Go.

198
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,084
Oh, Fili and Kili.
I'd quite forgotten. Yes.

199
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:37,529
Oh, yes, and Nori, Bofur, Bifur...

200
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,650
and Bombur.

201
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,404
Is that it?

202
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,725
Are there any more?

203
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,766
So you are the one they call Oakenshield.

204
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,695
Tell me...

205
00:21:06,405 --> 00:21:09,486
why is Azog the Defiler hunting you?

206
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,605
You know of Azog?

207
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,608
How?

208
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,644
My people were the first
to live in the mountains...

209
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,606
before the Orcs came
down from the North.

210
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,963
The Defiler killed most of my family.

211
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,801
But some he enslaved.

212
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,965
Not for work, you understand...

213
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,645
but for sport.

214
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,080
Caging skin-changers and torturing
them seemed to amuse him.

215
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,125
There are others like you?

216
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,202
- Once there were many.
- And now?

217
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,529
Now there is only one.

218
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:57,206
You need to reach the mountain
before the last days of autumn.

219
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,767
Before Durin's Day falls. Yes.

220
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,890
You are running out of time.

221
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,327
Which is why we must go through Mirkwood.

222
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,370
A darkness lies upon that forest.

223
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,649
Fell things creep beneath those trees.

224
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:15,163
I would not venture there,
except in great need.

225
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,402
We will take the Elven Road.

226
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,680
That path is still safe.

227
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,961
"Safe"?

228
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,080
The Wood Elves of Mirkwood
are not like their kin.

229
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,249
They're less wise and more dangerous.

230
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,284
But it matters not.

231
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,281
What do you mean?

232
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,285
These lands are crawling with Orcs.

233
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,725
Their numbers are growing.

234
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,945
And you are on foot.

235
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,608
You will never reach the forest alive.

236
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,401
I don't like Dwarves.

237
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,201
They're greedy and blind.

238
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:02,886
Blind to the lives of those
they deem lesser than their own.

239
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,761
But Orcs I hate more.

240
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,250
What do you need?

241
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,884
You will leave my ponies
before you enter the forest.

242
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,849
Oh, you have my word.

243
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,566
- We're being watched.
- Yes.

244
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,047
The Orcs will not give up.

245
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,250
They will hunt the Dwarves
until they see them destroyed.

246
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,251
Why now? What has made the Defiler
crawl from his hole?

247
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,205
There is an alliance
between the Orcs of Moria...

248
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,482
and the sorcerer in Dol Guldur.

249
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,844
- Are you sure of this?
- Packs have been seen gathering there.

250
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,481
Each day, more and more come.

251
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,288
What do you know of this sorcerer?

252
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,107
The one they call the Necromancer.

253
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,966
I know he is not what he seems.

254
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,124
Fell things are drawn to his power.

255
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,285
Azog pays homage to him.

256
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,806
Gandalf.

257
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,607
Time is wasting.

258
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,748
There is more.

259
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,758
Not long past, word spread...

260
00:24:18,979 --> 00:24:23,590
the dead had been seen walking
near the High Fells of Rhudaur.

261
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,680
The dead?

262
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,450
Is it true?

263
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,490
Are there tombs in those mountains?

264
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,088
<i>When Angmar fell...</i>

265
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,682
<i>the Men of the North took his body
and all that he possessed...</i>

266
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,680
<i>and sealed it within the High
Fells of Rhudaur.</i>

267
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,130
<i>Deep within the rock, they buried him.</i>

268
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,254
<i>In a tomb so dark...</i>

269
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,207
<i>it would never come to light.</i>

270
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,167
Yes, there are tombs up there.

271
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:05,287
I remember a time when a great
evil ruled these lands.

272
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,048
One powerful enough to raise the dead.

273
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,969
If that enemy has returned to Middle-earth...

274
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,607
I would have you tell me.

275
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,481
Saruman the White says it's not possible.

276
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,566
The enemy was destroyed
and will never return.

277
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,325
And what does Gandalf the Grey say?

278
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,010
Go now.

279
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,888
While you have the light.

280
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,529
Your hunters are not far behind.

281
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,041
The Elven Gate.

282
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,290
Here lies our path through Mirkwood.

283
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,689
No sign of the Orcs.
We have luck on our side.

284
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,048
Set the ponies loose.

285
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,126
Let them return to their master.

286
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,651
This forest feels...

287
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,361
sick.

288
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,047
As if a disease lies upon it.

289
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,164
Is there no way around?

290
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,880
Not unless we go 200 miles north.

291
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:56,446
Or twice that distance south.

292
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,723
<i>Something moves in the shadows unseen...</i>

293
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,560
<i>hidden from our sight.</i>

294
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,604
<i>Every day it grows in strength.</i>

295
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,206
<i>Beware the Necromancer.</i>

296
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,842
<i>He is not what he seems.</i>

297
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,847
<i>If our Enemy has returned,
we must know.</i>

298
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,964
<i>Go to the tombs in the mountains.</i>

299
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,882
The High Fells.

300
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,325
So be it.

301
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,846
Not my horse!
I need it!

302
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,686
You're not leaving us?

303
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,684
I would not do this unless I had to.

304
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,606
You've changed...

305
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,609
Bilbo Baggins.

306
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,049
You're not the same Hobbit
as the one who left the Shire.

307
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,530
I was going to tell you.

308
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,246
I...

309
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,202
found something in the Goblin tunnels.

310
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,811
Found what?

311
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,403
What did you find?

312
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,120
My courage.

313
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,968
Good. Well, that's good.

314
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,609
You'll need it.

315
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,886
I'll be waiting for you at the overlook,
before the slopes of Erebor.

316
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,487
Keep the map and key safe.

317
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,730
Do not enter that mountain without me.

318
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,883
This is not the Greenwood of old.

319
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,448
There is a stream in the woods
that carries a dark enchantment.

320
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,603
Do not touch the water.

321
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,241
Cross only by the stone bridge.

322
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,086
The very air of the forest
is heavy with illusion.

323
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,051
It'll seek to enter your mind
and lead you astray.

324
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,209
"Lead us astray"?

325
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,005
What does that mean?

326
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,489
You must stay on the path.
Do not leave it.

327
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,206
If you do, you'll never find it again.

328
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,643
No matter what may come, stay on the path!

329
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,043
Come on. We must reach the mountain
before the sun sets on Durin's Day.

330
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,281
- Durin's Day?
- Let's go.

331
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,040
It is our one chance
to find the hidden door.

332
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,450
The path turns this way.

333
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,686
This way.

334
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,443
Air. I need air.

335
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,728
My head, it's swimming!

336
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,930
- We found the bridge.
- Bridge.

337
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,283
We could try and swim it.

338
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,807
Didn't you hear what Gandalf said?

339
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,089
A dark magic lies upon this forest.

340
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,769
The waters of this stream are enchanted.

341
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,851
Doesn't look very enchanting to me.

342
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,845
We must find another way across.

343
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,289
These vines look strong enough.

344
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,204
Kili!

345
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,329
We send the lightest first.

346
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,604
It's all right.

347
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,210
Can't see any problem.

348
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,726
There's one.

349
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,404
Everything's fine.

350
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,691
Something is not right.

351
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,490
This is not right at all.

352
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,007
Stay where you are!

353
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,610
I can't get a grip.

354
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,804
What are you doing?

355
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,807
You shouldn't have done that.

356
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,365
- It's bad luck.
- I don't believe in luck.

357
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,690
We make our own luck.

358
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,843
We need to take a rest.

359
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,720
What is that?

360
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,089
Those voices.

361
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,926
Can you hear them?

362
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,850
I hear nothing.

363
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,006
No wind...

364
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,441
no birds.

365
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,884
What hour is it?

366
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,805
I do not know.

367
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,600
I do not even know what day it is.

368
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,403
This is taking too long.

369
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:27,081
Is there no end to this accursed forest?

370
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,606
None that I can see.

371
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,486
Only trees and more trees.

372
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,570
This way.

373
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,763
- Gandalf said...
- Do as I say. Follow me.

374
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,327
<i>Attercop.</i>

375
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,723
No, no, wait.

376
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,163
Wait.

377
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,564
Stop.

378
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,233
We can't...

379
00:36:22,405 --> 00:36:25,442
leave the path...
We must stay on the path.

380
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,447
I don't remember this place.

381
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,324
None of it's familiar.

382
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,329
It's got to be here.

383
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,930
It can't have just disappeared.

384
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,561
Unless someone's moved it.

385
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,167
It's not over here neither.

386
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,080
Look.

387
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,930
A tobacco pouch.

388
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,606
There's Dwarves in these woods.

389
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,491
Dwarves from the Blue Mountains, no less.

390
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,370
This is exactly the same as mine.

391
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,291
Because it is yours. Do you understand?

392
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,369
We're going around in circles.
We are lost.

393
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,648
We are not lost.
We keep heading east.

394
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,531
But which way is east?
We've lost the sun.

395
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,280
I thought you were the expert.

396
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,281
<i>The sun.</i>

397
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,764
<i>We have to find...</i>

398
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,280
<i>the sun.</i>

399
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,281
Up there.

400
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,125
We need to get above the canopy.

401
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,043
What was that?

402
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,130
Enough! Quiet! All of you!

403
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,844
We're being watched.

404
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,004
I can see a lake!

405
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,002
And a river.

406
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,370
And the Lonely Mountain.

407
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,609
We're almost there!

408
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,851
Can you hear me?

409
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,282
I know which way to go!

410
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,726
Hello?

411
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,286
Hello.

412
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,360
Oh, no.

413
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,560
Oh, come on.

414
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,251
Kill them! Kill them.

415
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,528
Eat them now,
while their blood is running.

416
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,282
Their hide is tough,
but there's good juice inside.

417
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:40,148
Stick it again. Finish it off.

418
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,329
The meat's alive and kicking!

419
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,162
Kill him.
Kill him now.

420
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,004
Let us feast.

421
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,240
Feast! Feast!

422
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,802
Feast! Feast!

423
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,605
Eat them alive!

424
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,888
Feast!

425
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,123
- What is it?
- What is it?

426
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,207
Eat them alive!

427
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,568
Fat and juicy.

428
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,361
Just a little taste.

429
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,407
Curse it! Where is it?! Where is it?!

430
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,886
Here.

431
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:36,763
It stings!

432
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
It stings!

433
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,171
Sting.

434
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,406
That's a good name.

435
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,326
Sting.

436
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,444
You all right there, Bofur?

437
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,006
- I'm all right!
- Get it off me!

438
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,366
Where's Bilbo?

439
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,600
I'm up here!

440
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,760
Pull!

441
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:52,721
Pull!

442
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,087
Where is it? Where is it?
Come on.

443
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,961
Where is it?

444
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,120
No!

445
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,806
No! No!

446
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,008
Thorin! Get them!

447
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,240
Come on!

448
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,444
Look out, brother!

449
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,200
Fili!

450
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,971
Mine.

451
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,761
Come on, keep up!

452
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,246
We're clear!

453
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,561
Do not think I won't kill you, Dwarf.

454
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,484
It would be my pleasure.

455
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,770
- Help!
- Kili!

456
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:31,961
Throw me a dagger!

457
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:33,881
Quick!

458
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,609
If you think I'm giving
you a weapon, Dwarf...

459
00:46:36,635 --> 00:46:37,690
you're mistaken!

460
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,365
Search them.

461
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,968
B'ey! Give it back! That's private!

462
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,401
Who is this?

463
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,686
- Your brother?
- That is my wife!

464
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,042
And what is this horrid creature?

465
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,446
A Goblin-mutant?

466
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,903
That's my wee lad, Gimli.

467
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,920
Where did you get this?

468
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,486
It was given to me.

469
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:45,328
Not just a thief, but a liar as well.

470
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,605
Thorin, where's Bilbo?

471
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,322
This is not the end of it!

472
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,845
- Do you hear me?!
- Hey, let us out of here!

473
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,645
Get off me!

474
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,045
Aren't you going to search me?

475
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,887
I could have anything down my trousers.

476
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,284
Or nothing.

477
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,040
- Again!
- Leave it!

478
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,131
There's no way out!

479
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,362
This is no Orc dungeon.

480
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,120
These are the Halls of the Woodland Realm.

481
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:05,200
No one leaves here
but by the king's consent.

482
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:13,441
Some may imagine
that a noble quest is at hand.

483
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:18,929
A quest to reclaim a homeland
and slay a dragon.

484
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:24,325
I myself suspect a more prosaic motive.

485
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,850
Attempted burglary.

486
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,887
Or something of that ilk.

487
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,041
You have found a way in.

488
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:39,484
You seek that which would bestow
upon you the right to rule.

489
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,049
The King's Jewel.

490
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,750
The Arkenstone.

491
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,042
It is precious to you beyond measure.

492
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,769
I understand that.

493
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:57,361
There are gems in the mountain
that I too desire.

494
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,968
White gems of pure starlight.

495
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,287
I offer you my help.

496
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,845
I am listening.

497
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:15,405
I will let you go if you
but return what is mine.

498
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,280
- A favor for a favor.
- You have my word.

499
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:25,046
One king to another.

500
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:34,447
I would not trust Thranduil,
the great king...

501
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:38,606
to honor his word, should the end
of all days be upon us!

502
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,777
You, who lack all honor!

503
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,648
I have seen how you treat your friends.

504
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:51,645
We came to you once, starving,
homeless, seeking your help.

505
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,567
But you turned your back!

506
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,487
You turned away from the suffering
of my people...

507
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,728
and the inferno that destroyed us.

508
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,602
Do not talk to me of dragon fire.

509
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:08,961
I know its wrath and ruin.

510
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:17,365
I have faced the great
serpents of the North.

511
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:23,828
I warned your grandfather
of what his greed would summon.

512
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,203
But he would not listen.

513
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,808
You are just like him.

514
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:39,850
Stay here if you will and rot.

515
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:44,242
A hundred years is a mere
blink in the life of an Elf.

516
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,164
I'm patient.

517
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,202
I can wait.

518
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:57,761
Did he offer you a deal?

519
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,161
He did.

520
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,859
I told him he could go
<i>îsh kakhfê ai-'d dûr-rugnu!</i>

521
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,861
Him and all his kin!

522
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,604
Well, that's that, then.

523
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:13,800
A deal was our only hope.

524
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,009
Not our only hope.

525
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,291
I know you're there.

526
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:32,084
Why do you linger in the shadows?

527
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,481
I was coming to report to you.

528
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:40,008
I thought I ordered that nest
to be destroyed not two moons past.

529
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,882
We cleared the forest as ordered, my lord.

530
00:53:42,883 --> 00:53:44,948
But more spiders keep
coming up from the South.

531
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,389
They are spawning in the ruins of Dol Guldur.
If we could kill them at their source...

532
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,808
That fortress lies beyond our borders.

533
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:53,845
Keep our lands clear of those foul creatures.
That is your task.

534
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,726
And when we drive them off, what then?

535
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,570
Will they not spread to other lands?

536
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,684
Other lands are not my concern.

537
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,081
The fortunes of the world will rise and fall.

538
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,560
But here in this kingdom, we will endure.

539
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,520
Legolas said you fought well today.

540
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,569
He has grown very fond of you.

541
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,082
I assure you, my lord.

542
00:54:26,208 --> 00:54:29,675
Legolas thinks of me as no more
than a captain of the guard.

543
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,523
Perhaps he did once.

544
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:35,086
Now I am not so sure.

545
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:43,846
I do not think you would allow your son
to pledge himself to a lowly Silvan Elf.

546
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,491
No, you are right. I would not.

547
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,527
Still, he cares about you.

548
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,886
Do not give him hope where there is none.

549
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:34,323
The stone in your hand, what is it?

550
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,285
It is a talisman.

551
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,325
A powerful spell lies upon it.

552
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,956
If any but a Dwarf reads
the runes on this stone...

553
00:55:47,282 --> 00:55:49,185
they will be forever cursed.

554
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:55,603
Or not.

555
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,120
Depending on whether you believe
in that kind of thing. It's just a token.

556
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,326
A rune stone.

557
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,243
My mother gave it to me so
I'd remember my promise.

558
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,366
What promise?

559
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,245
That I would come back to her.

560
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,400
She worries.

561
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,410
She thinks I'm reckless.

562
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,246
Are you?

563
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,122
Nah.

564
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:40,405
Sounds like quite a party
you're having up there.

565
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,088
It is <i>Mereth e-nGilith...</i>

566
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,525
the Feast of Starlight.

567
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:49,161
All light is sacred to the Eldar.

568
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:53,208
But Wood Elves love best
the light of the stars.

569
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,370
I always thought it is a cold light.

570
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,761
Remote and far away.

571
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:05,769
It is memory, precious and pure.

572
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:11,771
Like your promise.

573
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,089
I have walked there sometimes.

574
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,765
Beyond the forest and up into the night.

575
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,364
I have seen the world fall away...

576
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:35,410
and the white light of forever fill the air.

577
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,689
I saw a fire moon once.

578
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,251
It rose over the pass near Dunland. Huge.

579
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:48,086
Red and gold, it was. It filled the sky.

580
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,890
We were an escort for some merchants
from Ered Luin. They were...

581
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:56,283
trading in silverwork for furs.
We took the Greenway south...

582
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,808
keeping the mountain to our left.

583
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,770
And then it appeared.

584
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:05,130
This huge fire moon lighting our path.

585
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,647
I wish I could show you the caverns...

586
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,565
Galion, you old rogue,
we're running out of drink.

587
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:15,209
These empty barrels should have been
sent back to Esgaroth hours ago.

588
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,488
The bargeman will be waiting for them.

589
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:22,402
Say what you like about our ill-tempered king.
He has excellent taste in wine.

590
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,925
Come, Elros, try it.

591
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:27,721
I have the Dwarves in my charge.

592
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:30,244
They're locked up.
Where can they go?

593
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,691
I'll wager the sun is on the rise.

594
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:38,649
Must be nearly dawn.

595
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,201
We're never gonna reach the mountain, are we?

596
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,242
Not stuck in here, you're not.

597
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:52,849
Bilbo!

598
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,080
What?

599
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,451
There are guards nearby!

600
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,200
Close the doors.

601
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:07,567
- It'll buy us more time.
- All right, Nori.

602
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:19,960
- Up the stairs.
- You first.

603
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:20,683
Ori.

604
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:22,600
Not that way. Down here.
Follow me.

605
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:24,760
Go.

606
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,365
Easy, now.

607
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:42,521
This way.

608
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:46,407
Come on.

609
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:48,250
I don't believe it.
We're in the cellars!

610
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,449
You were supposed to be leading us out,
not further in!

611
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:51,520
I know what I'm doing!

612
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,444
This way! This way!

613
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:02,162
Everyone, climb into the barrels quickly.

614
01:00:02,166 --> 01:00:03,465
Are you mad?

615
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:04,743
- They'll find us.
- No, no.

616
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:05,827
They won't, I promise you.

617
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:09,487
Please, please. You must trust me.

618
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,441
Do as he says.

619
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:16,920
Move your big ginger head.

620
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,763
Bifur, get in the barrel! Move!

621
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,130
Everyone's in.

622
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,169
What do we do now?

623
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:36,921
Hold your breath.

624
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,760
Hold my breath? What do you mean?

625
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:06,365
Where is the Keeper of the Keys?

626
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:34,726
Well done, Master Baggins.

627
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,441
Go! Come on, let's go!

628
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,090
Hold on!

629
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:03,651
Bilbo!

630
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:09,480
Hang on!

631
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:39,523
No!

632
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:55,454
Watch out! There's Orcs!

633
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:15,280
Get under the bridge!

634
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:28,880
Kili!

635
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:54,800
Kili!

636
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:02,560
Kili.

637
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:57,240
Kili!

638
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:22,286
Nori!

639
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:36,161
Cut the log!

640
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,240
Bombur!

641
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:21,720
Tauriel.

642
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:20,601
Oh, it's you!

643
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:22,451
Why am I here, Gandalf?

644
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:23,886
Trust me, Radagast.

645
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:27,090
I would not have called you here
without good reason.

646
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:34,211
This is not a nice place to meet.

647
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:35,566
No.

648
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:38,310
It is not.

649
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:41,606
These are dark spells, Gandalf.

650
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:44,565
Old and full of hate.

651
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,171
Who's buried here?

652
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:49,888
If he had a name,
it's long since been lost.

653
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:54,761
He would have been known
only as a servant of evil.

654
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:59,288
One of a number.

655
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,363
One of nine.

656
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:11,217
Why now, Gandalf? I don't understand.

657
01:11:11,317 --> 01:11:13,409
The Ringwraiths have
been summoned to Dol Guldur.

658
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:15,608
But it cannot be the Necromancer.

659
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:19,367
A human sorcerer could not summon such evil.

660
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,568
Who said it was human?

661
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:26,881
The Nine only answer to one master.

662
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:29,726
We've been blind, Radagast.

663
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:32,042
And in our blindness...

664
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:34,408
the Enemy has returned.

665
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,042
He is summoning his servants.

666
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:43,683
Azog the Defiler is no ordinary hunter.

667
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,251
He is a commander.

668
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:48,042
A commander of legions.

669
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:52,491
The Enemy is preparing for war.

670
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:54,850
It will begin in the East.

671
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,891
His mind is set upon that mountain.

672
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:00,003
- Where are you going?
- To rejoin the others.

673
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:01,307
Gandalf.

674
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:05,125
I started this. I cannot forsake them.

675
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:07,283
They are in grave danger.

676
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:11,771
If what you say is true
the world is in grave danger.

677
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:16,441
The power in that fortress
will only grow stronger.

678
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:20,889
You want me to cast my friends aside?

679
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:26,201
- Anything behind us?
- Not that I can see.

680
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:34,680
- I think we've outrun the Orcs.
- Not for long. We've lost the current.

681
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:36,649
Bombur's half drowned.

682
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:38,969
- Make for the shore!
- Aye.

683
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:40,280
Come on, let's go!

684
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,209
Gloin, help me, my brother.

685
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:46,409
Come on, lift yourself.

686
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:48,001
Come on!

687
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:50,686
Come on, you big lump, you!

688
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,529
I'm fine. It's nothing.

689
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:03,760
On your feet.

690
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:05,968
Kili's wounded. His leg needs binding.

691
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:08,601
There's an Orc pack on our tail.
We keep moving.

692
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:11,923
- To where?
- To the mountain. We're so close.

693
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:15,410
A lake lies between us
and that mountain.

694
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:17,927
- We have no way to cross it.
- So then we go around.

695
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:21,170
The Orcs will run us down,
as sure as daylight.

696
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:23,482
We've no weapons to defend ourselves.

697
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:25,404
Bind his leg, quickly.

698
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,490
You have two minutes.

699
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:50,601
Do it again and you're dead.

700
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:57,889
Excuse me but you're from Lake-town,
if I'm not mistaken.

701
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:04,888
That barge over there, it wouldn't be
available for hire, by any chance?

702
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:08,642
What makes you think I would help you?

703
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,729
Those boots have seen better days.

704
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,890
As has that coat.

705
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:15,928
No doubt you have some hungry mouths to feed.

706
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:18,451
How many bairns?

707
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:21,010
A boy and two girls.

708
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,571
And your wife, I imagine she's a beauty.

709
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:26,921
Aye.

710
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:28,441
She was.

711
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:33,170
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

712
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,283
Oh, come on, come on.
Enough of the niceties.

713
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:38,086
What's your hurry?

714
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:39,566
What's it to you?

715
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:44,360
I would like to know who you
are and what you are doing in these lands.

716
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:47,006
We are simple merchants
from the Blue Mountains...

717
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:50,650
journeying to see our kin in the Iron Hills.

718
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:54,008
Simple merchants, you say?

719
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:57,808
We need food, supplies, weapons.

720
01:14:58,040 --> 01:14:59,201
Can you help us?

721
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:06,005
I know where these barrels came from.

722
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:08,000
What of it?

723
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:10,686
I don't know what business
you had with the Elves...

724
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:12,929
but I don't think it ended well.

725
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:17,488
No one enters Lake-town
but by leave of the Master.

726
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:20,885
All his wealth comes from trade
with the Woodland Realm.

727
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:23,925
He would see you in irons before risking
the wrath of King Thranduil.

728
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:27,207
Offer him more.

729
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:32,563
I'll wager there are ways
to enter that town unseen.

730
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:34,521
Aye.

731
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:37,120
But for that...

732
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:39,731
you would need a smuggler.

733
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:41,883
For which we would pay double.

734
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:53,158
<i>Such is the nature of evil.</i>

735
01:15:53,826 --> 01:15:58,441
Out there in the vast ignorance
of the world it festers and spreads.

736
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:01,411
A shadow that grows in the dark.

737
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,884
A sleepless malice as black
as the oncoming wall of night.

738
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:09,970
So it ever was.

739
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:12,568
So will it always be.

740
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:17,821
In time, all foul things come forth.

741
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:20,730
You were tracking
a company of 13 Dwarves.

742
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:21,960
Why?

743
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:23,491
Not 13.

744
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:25,285
Not anymore.

745
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,523
The young one, the black-haired archer...

746
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,962
we stuck him with a Morgul shaft.

747
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:35,781
The poison's in his blood.

748
01:16:36,809 --> 01:16:38,447
He'll be choking on it soon.

749
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:40,649
Answer the question, filth.

750
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:47,769
I would not antagonize her.

751
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:50,169
You like killing things, Orc?

752
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:52,845
You like death?

753
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:55,280
Then let me give it to you.

754
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:15,645
I do not care about one dead Dwarf.
Answer the question.

755
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:18,290
You have nothing to fear.

756
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:21,660
Tell us what you know
and I will set you free.

757
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:24,921
You had orders to kill them. Why?

758
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:27,562
What is Thorin Oakenshield to you?

759
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:31,642
- The Dwarf runt will never be king.
- King?

760
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:34,963
There is no King Under the Mountain,
nor will there ever be.

761
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:39,380
None would dare enter Erebor
whilst the dragon lives.

762
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:43,526
You know nothing.
Your world will burn.

763
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:45,404
What are you talking about?

764
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:47,126
Speak!

765
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:50,370
Our time has come again.

766
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,279
My master serves the One.

767
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:58,206
Do you understand now, Elfling?

768
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:00,323
Death is upon you.

769
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:04,650
The flames of war are upon you.

770
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:08,767
Why did you do that?

771
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:11,123
You promised to set him free.

772
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:12,486
And I did.

773
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:16,763
I freed his wretched head
from his miserable shoulders.

774
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,964
There was more the Orc could tell us.

775
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:23,647
There was nothing more he could tell me.

776
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:27,080
What did he mean by "the flames of war"?

777
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:32,442
It means they intend to unleash a weapon
so great it will destroy all before it.

778
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:36,522
I want the watch doubled at our borders.
All roads, all rivers.

779
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:38,524
Nothing moves, but I hear of it.

780
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,585
No one enters this kingdom.

781
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:42,965
And no one leaves it.

782
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:09,440
Watch out!

783
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:20,730
What are you trying to do, drown us?

784
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,571
I was born and bred on these waters,
Master Dwarf.

785
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:27,044
If I wanted to drown you,
I would not do it here.

786
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:31,521
Oh, I've had enough of this lippy Lakeman.

787
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:34,531
I say we throw him over the side
and be done with it.

788
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,759
- Bard, his name's Bard.
- How do you know?

789
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:39,251
I asked him.

790
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:42,091
I don't care what he calls himself.
I don't like him.

791
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:45,770
We do not have to like him.
We simply have to pay him.

792
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:49,007
Come on now, lads.
Turn out your pockets.

793
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:53,320
- How do we know he won't betray us?
- We don't.

794
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:56,767
There's... just a wee problem.

795
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,045
We're 10 coins short.

796
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:02,549
Gloin.

797
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:04,283
Come on.

798
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:06,448
- Give us what you have.
- Don't look to me.

799
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:11,201
I have been bled dry by this venture.

800
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:14,046
What have I seen for my investment?

801
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:17,767
Naught but misery and grief and...

802
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:28,088
Bless my beard.

803
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:30,081
Take it.

804
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:32,411
Take all of it.

805
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:37,775
The money, quick. Give it to me.

806
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:40,489
We will pay you when we get
our provisions but not before.

807
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:43,200
If you value your freedom,
you'll do as I say.

808
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:44,926
There are guards ahead.

809
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:04,845
What's he doing?

810
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:06,440
He's talking to someone.

811
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:10,121
He's pointing right at us.

812
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:15,040
Now they're shaking hands.

813
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,645
- What?
- The villain.

814
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:18,211
He's selling us out.

815
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:42,200
Quiet.

816
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:46,649
We're approaching the tollgate.

817
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Halt!

818
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:00,491
Goods inspection!

819
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:03,083
Papers, please!

820
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:05,080
Oh, it's you, Bard.

821
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:06,367
Morning, Percy.

822
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:07,806
Anything to declare?

823
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:12,127
Nothing, but that I am cold
and tired and ready for home.

824
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:13,600
You and me both.

825
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:19,131
There we are.

826
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:20,360
All in order.

827
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:23,284
Not so fast.

828
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:27,768
"Consignment of empty barrels
from the Woodland Realm."

829
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:30,368
Only...

830
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:35,806
they're not empty.
Are they, Bard?

831
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:39,567
If I recall correctly you're
licensed as a bargeman.

832
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:44,200
Not a fisherman.

833
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:45,925
That's none of your business.

834
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:47,640
Wrong.

835
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:51,287
It's the Master's business,
which makes it my business.

836
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:54,091
Oh, come on, Alfrid, have a heart.
People need to eat.

837
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,561
These fish are illegal.

838
01:23:57,320 --> 01:24:01,314
- Empty the barrels, over the side.
- You heard him. In the canal.

839
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:04,448
Come on. Get a move on.

840
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:06,484
Folk in this town are struggling.

841
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:09,487
Times are hard.
Food is scarce.

842
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:10,846
That's not my problem.

843
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:14,970
And when the people hear the Master is dumping
fish back in the lake...

844
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:17,090
when the rioting starts...

845
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:21,285
will it be your problem then?

846
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:27,361
Stop.

847
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,553
Ever the people's champion eh, Bard?

848
01:24:33,737 --> 01:24:35,448
Protector of the common folk.

849
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:38,780
You might have their favor now,
bargeman but it won't last.

850
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:43,486
Raise the gate!

851
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:48,529
The Master has his eye on you.

852
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:50,250
You'd do well to remember:

853
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:52,045
We know where you live.

854
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:53,964
It's a small town, Alfrid.

855
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:56,728
Everyone knows where everyone lives.

856
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:15,201
All this talk of civil unrest.

857
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:17,124
Someone's been stirring the pot, sire.

858
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:21,761
Gout playing up, sire?

859
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,167
It's the damp.

860
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:24,600
It's the only possible explanation.

861
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:26,041
Get me a brandy.

862
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:29,730
The mood of the people, sire,
it's turning ugly.

863
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:32,930
They're commoners, Alfrid.
They've always been ugly.

864
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:37,691
It's not my fault they live in a place
that stinks of fish oil and tar.

865
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:43,450
Jobs, shelter, food.
It's all they ever bleat about.

866
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:47,121
It's my belief, sire, they are being
led on by troublemakers.

867
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:52,003
Then we must find these
troublemakers and arrest them.

868
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:54,163
My thoughts exactly, sire.

869
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:57,244
And all this talk of change
must be suppressed.

870
01:25:57,480 --> 01:26:01,424
Can't afford to let the rabble band
together and start making noises.

871
01:26:01,450 --> 01:26:04,909
The next thing you know,
they'll start asking questions...

872
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:06,724
forming committees...

873
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:09,125
launching inquiries.

874
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:11,840
Out with the old, in with the new?

875
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:13,560
What?

876
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,808
That's what they've been saying, sire.

877
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:19,826
- There is even talk of an election.
- An election?

878
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:23,222
That's absurd.
I won't stand for it.

879
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:26,761
I don't think they'd ask
you to stand, sire.

880
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:30,210
Shirkers.

881
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:31,440
Ingrates.

882
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:32,647
Rabble-rousers.

883
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:35,611
Who would have the nerve
to question my authority?

884
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:37,525
Who would dare?

885
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:38,761
Who?

886
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:45,045
Bard.

887
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:47,650
You mark my words.

888
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:51,164
That trouble-making bargeman
is behind all this.

889
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:54,048
- No one else would have the...
- Bollocks, sire.

890
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:58,640
Ram and goat, sautéed in a lovely
little mushroom gravy.

891
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:03,240
In an ideal world, sire, we'd arrest him.

892
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:06,690
But Bard has the favor of the people.

893
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:09,446
They see him as a leader.

894
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:13,361
Someone they can truly admire.

895
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:16,645
Modest, intelligent...

896
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:19,605
handsome, athletic...

897
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:23,447
Yes, he's clearly modeling himself on me.

898
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:25,762
That's no crime.

899
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:28,526
I wonder...

900
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:38,400
I wonder if some ancient law might exist
that forbids bargemen from asking questions.

901
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:44,125
You think such a venerable
statute might exist?

902
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:48,531
Almost certainly, sire.

903
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:53,565
I'll write one immediately.

904
01:27:58,120 --> 01:28:03,450
You picked the wrong man
to tangle with, Master Bard.

905
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:07,564
I hope you're watching yourself,
because I'll be watching you.

906
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:17,761
Get your hands off me.

907
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:27,120
You didn't see them.
They were never here.

908
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:30,404
The fish you can have for nothing.

909
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:34,883
Stay close.

910
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:39,606
Follow me.

911
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:40,840
What is this place?

912
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:43,884
This, Mr. Baggins, is the world of Men.

913
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:45,406
Get it over here now.

914
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:47,642
Grab the other end. That's it.

915
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:50,091
Keep your head's down, keep moving.

916
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:51,320
Quickly, now.

917
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:54,444
God, how many more are there?

918
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:56,880
Halt.

919
01:28:58,560 --> 01:28:59,129
Come on. Move.

920
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:02,500
In the name of the Master of Lake-town.
I said halt.

921
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:04,240
Halt!

922
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:05,600
Stop them!

923
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:08,040
- Get back.
- Come here.

924
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:32,565
What's going on here?

925
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:37,167
Stay where you are. Nobody leaves.

926
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:46,568
Braga.

927
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:47,847
- Sorry?
- You.

928
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:51,086
What are you up to, Bard?

929
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,367
Me?
Nothing.

930
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:54,965
I'm looking for nothing.

931
01:29:58,480 --> 01:29:59,480
Yeah.

932
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:07,444
Hey, Braga.

933
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:10,690
Your wife would look lovely in this.

934
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:14,131
What do you know of my wife?

935
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:17,324
I know her as well
as any man in this town.

936
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:33,361
Da!

937
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:35,649
Our house, it's being watched.

938
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:14,289
You can tell the Master I'm
done for the day.

939
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:18,087
Da! Where have you been?

940
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:21,330
Father! There you are! I was worried.

941
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:23,091
Here, Sigrid.

942
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:24,640
Bain, get them in.

943
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:36,645
If you speak of this to anyone
I'll rip your arms off.

944
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:41,010
Get off.

945
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:43,521
Up there.

946
01:31:51,580 --> 01:31:54,801
Da, why are there Dwarves
climbing out of our toilet?

947
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:56,171
Will they bring us luck?

948
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:03,604
They may not be the best fit
but they'll keep you warm.

949
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:05,627
Thank you very much.

950
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:17,602
A Dwarvish windlance.

951
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:20,046
You look like you've seen a ghost.

952
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:21,961
He has.

953
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:25,684
The last time we saw such a weapon...

954
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:28,407
a city was on fire.

955
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:31,881
It was the day the dragon came.

956
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:37,966
<i>The day that Smaug destroyed Dale.</i>

957
01:32:40,440 --> 01:32:42,647
<i>Girion, the Lord of the City...</i>

958
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:45,006
<i>rallied his bowmen to fire upon the beast.</i>

959
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:50,642
But a dragon's hide is tough.
Tougher than the strongest armor.

960
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:55,924
Only a Black Arrow fired from a windlance
could have pierced the dragon's hide.

961
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:59,969
<i>And few of those arrows were ever made.</i>

962
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:09,432
<i>The store was running low when
Girion made his last stand.</i>

963
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:20,122
Had the aim of Men been true that day...

964
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:22,563
much would have been different.

965
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:28,603
You speak as if you were there.

966
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:32,088
All Dwarves know the tale.

967
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:34,607
Then you would know
that Girion hit the dragon.

968
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:36,729
He loosened a scale under the left wing.

969
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,778
One more shot
and he would have killed the beast.

970
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:42,089
That's a fairy story, lad.

971
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:43,731
Nothing more.

972
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:46,085
You took our money.

973
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:48,446
Where are the weapons?

974
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:52,446
Wait here.

975
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:11,207
- Tomorrow begins the last days of autumn.
- Durin's Day falls the mom after next.

976
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:13,363
We must reach the mountain before then.

977
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:14,965
And if we do not?

978
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:17,521
If we fail to find the hidden door
before that time?

979
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:19,295
Then this quest has been for nothing.

980
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:32,806
What is this?

981
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:34,646
Pike hook.

982
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:36,041
Made from an old harpoon.

983
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:38,802
- And this?
- A crowbill, we call it.

984
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:40,610
Fashioned from a smithy's hammer.

985
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:43,904
It's heavy in hand, I grant
but in defense of your life...

986
01:34:44,208 --> 01:34:45,590
these will serve you better than none.

987
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:48,329
We paid you for weapons.

988
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:51,361
Iron-forged swords and axes!

989
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:52,600
It's a joke!

990
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:57,250
You won't find better outside the city armory.

991
01:34:57,480 --> 01:35:00,326
All iron-forged weapons are held
there under lock and key.

992
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:01,607
Thorin...

993
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:05,666
why not take what's on offer and go?
I've made do with less.

994
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:06,902
So have you.

995
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:11,122
- I say we leave now.
- You're not going anywhere.

996
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:14,000
- What did you say?
- There are spies watching this house...

997
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:16,725
and probably every dock
and wharf in the town.

998
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:19,122
You must wait till nightfall.

999
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:36,761
Thorin.

1000
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:50,926
Da?

1001
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:55,565
Don't let them leave.

1002
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:32,687
Tauriel, you cannot hunt
30 Orcs on your own.

1003
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:34,809
But I'm not on my own.

1004
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:36,926
You knew I would come.

1005
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:41,219
The king is angry, Tauriel.

1006
01:36:41,645 --> 01:36:45,309
For 600 years my father has
protected you, favored you.

1007
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:48,531
You defied his orders.
You betrayed his trust.

1008
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:01,287
The king has never let Orc
filth roam our lands.

1009
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:04,808
Yet he would let this Orc pack cross
our borders and kill our prisoners.

1010
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:08,125
- It is not our fight.
- It is our fight.

1011
01:37:08,640 --> 01:37:10,369
It will not end here.

1012
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:13,490
With every victory, this evil will grow.

1013
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:16,491
If your father has his way,
we will do nothing.

1014
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:18,842
We will hide within our walls...

1015
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:21,401
live our lives away from the light...

1016
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:23,205
and let darkness descend.

1017
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:26,969
Are we not part of this world?

1018
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:33,082
Tell me, <i>mellon.</i> When did we let
evil become stronger than us?

1019
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:40,691
Hello, Bard. What you after?

1020
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:43,290
There was a tapestry!

1021
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,128
An old one! Where's it gone?

1022
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:47,640
What tapestry you talking about?

1023
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:48,989
This one.

1024
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:52,362
They were Dwarves, I tell you.
Appeared out of nowhere.

1025
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:54,562
Full beards. Fierce eyes.

1026
01:37:54,840 --> 01:37:56,444
I've never seen the like.

1027
01:37:56,720 --> 01:37:58,802
What are Dwarves doing in these parts?

1028
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,720
- It's the prophecy.
- The prophecy?

1029
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:02,689
The Prophecy of Durin's Folk.

1030
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:13,525
Prophecy.

1031
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:18,361
Prophecy.

1032
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:19,886
The old tales will come true.

1033
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:22,401
Vast halls of treasure!

1034
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:24,802
Silver and gold and jewels beyond measure.

1035
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:26,147
Can you imagine?

1036
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:27,441
Can it really be true?

1037
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:30,411
Has the lord of silver fountains returned?

1038
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:33,291
<i>The lord of the silver fountains</i>

1039
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:35,807
<i>The King of carven stone</i>

1040
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:39,644
<i>The King beneath the mountain</i>

1041
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:42,763
<i>Shall come into his own!</i>

1042
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:45,969
<i>And the bell shall ring in gladness</i>

1043
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:48,565
<i>At the Mountain King's return</i>

1044
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:51,531
<i>But all shall fail in sadness</i>

1045
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:54,851
<i>And the lake will shine and burn.</i>

1046
01:38:57,840 --> 01:38:58,840
Da, I tried to stop them.

1047
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:00,485
How long have they been gone?

1048
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:06,284
- Can you see anything?
- Keep it down.

1049
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:09,485
As soon as we have the weapons
we make straight for the mountain.

1050
01:39:09,720 --> 01:39:10,926
Go, go, go!

1051
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:12,481
Go, Nori.

1052
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:16,601
Next.

1053
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:23,088
Prophecy?

1054
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:25,528
Who dragged up that old nonsense?

1055
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:28,721
People, sire.
They're gathering in the streets.

1056
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:32,043
They're saying that a king
will return to the Lonely Mountain...

1057
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:36,001
and that the rivers will once more
run with gold.

1058
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:41,801
- Rivers of gold? Poppycock.
- As you say, sire.

1059
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:44,880
But people will believe
what they want to believe.

1060
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:48,286
It's been a long time
since they've seen any riches.

1061
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:51,922
The old tales offer them hope.

1062
01:40:01,720 --> 01:40:02,881
You all right?

1063
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:04,406
I can manage.

1064
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:06,764
Let's just get out of here.

1065
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:21,760
Run!

1066
01:40:21,880 --> 01:40:23,006
Quickly! Move now!

1067
01:40:37,160 --> 01:40:38,366
Get off me! Get off!

1068
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:40,204
Move them along here.

1069
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:42,321
Move on!

1070
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:52,450
What is the meaning of this?

1071
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:55,807
We caught them stealing weapons, sire.

1072
01:40:56,500 --> 01:40:58,321
Enemies of the state, eh?

1073
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:01,762
A desperate bunch of mercenaries,
if ever there was, sire.

1074
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,240
Hold your tongue!

1075
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:08,222
You do not know to whom you speak.

1076
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:10,409
This is no common criminal.

1077
01:41:10,680 --> 01:41:12,045
This is Thorin...

1078
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:15,409
son of Thrain, son of Thror!

1079
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:20,642
We are the Dwarves of Erebor.

1080
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:26,523
We have come to reclaim our homeland.

1081
01:41:31,240 --> 01:41:34,244
I remember this town
in the great days of old.

1082
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:40,132
Fleets of boats lay at harbor
filled with silks and fine gems.

1083
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:42,847
This was no forsaken town on a lake.

1084
01:41:43,880 --> 01:41:46,765
This was the center of all trade in the North!

1085
01:41:48,700 --> 01:41:50,646
I would see those days return.

1086
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:53,206
I would relight the great
forges of the Dwarves...

1087
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:57,120
and send wealth and riches flowing
once more from the Halls of Erebor!

1088
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:01,589
Death!

1089
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:04,446
That is what you will bring upon us!

1090
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:07,004
Dragon fire and ruin.

1091
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:13,604
If you waken that beast
it will destroy us all.

1092
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:17,570
You can listen to this naysayer
but I promise you this:

1093
01:42:19,960 --> 01:42:21,405
If we succeed...

1094
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:25,286
all will share in the wealth of the mountain.

1095
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:34,206
You will have enough gold
to rebuild Esgaroth 10 times over!

1096
01:42:44,840 --> 01:42:46,842
Why should we take you at your word?

1097
01:42:47,160 --> 01:42:48,730
We know nothing about you.

1098
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:52,160
Who here can vouch for your character?

1099
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:00,920
Me.

1100
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:04,040
I'll vouch for him.

1101
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:09,682
I have traveled far with these
Dwarves through great danger...

1102
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:14,366
and if Thorin Oakenshield
gives his word...

1103
01:43:15,320 --> 01:43:17,482
then he will keep it.

1104
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:21,441
All of you!

1105
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:24,207
Listen to me!
You must listen!

1106
01:43:24,440 --> 01:43:26,169
Have you forgotten what happened to Dale?

1107
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:31,208
Have you forgotten those
who died in the firestorm?!

1108
01:43:33,480 --> 01:43:34,802
And for what purpose?

1109
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:37,729
The blind ambition of a Mountain King...

1110
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:42,365
so riven by greed, he could not
see beyond his own desire!

1111
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:45,204
Now, now!

1112
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:50,087
We must not, any of us be
too quick to lay blame.

1113
01:43:51,240 --> 01:43:56,063
Let us not forget that it
was Girion, Lord of Dale...

1114
01:43:56,080 --> 01:44:00,480
your ancestor, who failed
to kill the beast!

1115
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:05,008
It's true, sire.

1116
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:06,446
We all know the story.

1117
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:12,531
Arrow after arrow, he shot.
Each one missing its mark.

1118
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:20,566
You have no right.

1119
01:44:22,240 --> 01:44:24,163
No right to enter that mountain.

1120
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:28,008
I have the only right.

1121
01:44:34,360 --> 01:44:37,450
I speak to the Master of the Men
of the Lake.

1122
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:40,001
Will you see the prophecy fulfilled?

1123
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:46,046
Will you share in the great
wealth of our people?

1124
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:52,485
What say you?

1125
01:44:56,360 --> 01:44:59,409
I say unto you...

1126
01:45:00,680 --> 01:45:01,881
Welcome!

1127
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:03,200
Welcome!

1128
01:45:03,240 --> 01:45:05,481
And thrice, welcome...

1129
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:07,670
King Under the Mountain!

1130
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:21,966
You do know we're one short.
Where's Bofur?

1131
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:24,806
- If he's not here, we leave him behind.
- We'll have to.

1132
01:45:25,080 --> 01:45:28,851
If we're to find the door before nightfall,
we can risk no more delays.

1133
01:45:33,240 --> 01:45:34,240
Not you.

1134
01:45:34,840 --> 01:45:37,047
We must travel at speed.
You will slow us down.

1135
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:40,200
What are you talking about?
I'm coming with you.

1136
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:41,360
Not now.

1137
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:48,895
I'm going to be there
when that door is opened.

1138
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:51,160
When we first look upon
the Halls of our Fathers, Thorin.

1139
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:53,521
Kili, stay here.

1140
01:45:54,120 --> 01:45:55,281
Rest.

1141
01:45:56,080 --> 01:45:57,525
Join us when you're healed.

1142
01:46:03,120 --> 01:46:04,451
I'll stay with the lad.

1143
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:06,489
My duty lies with the wounded.

1144
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:07,720
Uncle.

1145
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:11,806
We grew up on tales of the mountain.
Tales you told us.

1146
01:46:12,040 --> 01:46:14,201
You cannot take
that away from him!

1147
01:46:14,440 --> 01:46:15,520
I will carry him if I must!

1148
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:18,161
One day you will be king
and you will understand.

1149
01:46:18,920 --> 01:46:22,208
I cannot risk the fate of this quest
for the sake of one Dwarf.

1150
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:29,840
Not even my own kin.
Fili, don't be a fool.

1151
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:31,920
You belong with the company.

1152
01:46:32,040 --> 01:46:33,690
I belong with my brother.

1153
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:48,046
By my beard, is that the time?!

1154
01:46:50,120 --> 01:46:54,811
<i>Go now with our goodwill
and good wishes.</i>

1155
01:46:56,120 --> 01:46:58,430
And may your return...

1156
01:46:58,489 --> 01:47:00,886
- bring good fortune to all!
- Wait!

1157
01:47:04,720 --> 01:47:05,767
Good bye.

1158
01:47:12,240 --> 01:47:12,843
Out of the way!

1159
01:47:13,080 --> 01:47:14,445
No! No!

1160
01:47:22,040 --> 01:47:23,288
So you missed the boat as well?

1161
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:24,881
Kili? Kili!

1162
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:27,725
Hey.

1163
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:29,889
Get out of there. Go on.

1164
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:33,324
Masterfully handled, sire.

1165
01:47:33,560 --> 01:47:35,528
Your popularity has never been so high.

1166
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:37,723
The entire town twittering your name.

1167
01:47:37,960 --> 01:47:39,803
Yes, it was rather clever.

1168
01:47:40,040 --> 01:47:42,202
Either our little friends return triumphant...

1169
01:47:42,440 --> 01:47:45,410
in which case, I stand
to make a pretty penny...

1170
01:47:45,680 --> 01:47:47,763
or old Smaug dines on Dwarf
for a day or two.

1171
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:51,649
The important thing is,
they're off our hands.

1172
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:52,880
Please, wait.

1173
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,286
Please. We need your help.

1174
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:57,090
- My brother is sick.
- Sick?

1175
01:47:57,360 --> 01:47:58,600
Is it infectious?

1176
01:47:58,840 --> 01:47:59,568
Get back.

1177
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:01,370
Alfrid, Alfrid...

1178
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:03,156
- don't let them come any closer.
- Please.

1179
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:05,124
We need medicine.

1180
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:08,164
Do I look like an apothecary?

1181
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:11,401
Haven't we given you enough?
The master's a busy man.

1182
01:48:11,640 --> 01:48:14,484
He hasn't got time to worry
about sick Dwarves.

1183
01:48:15,160 --> 01:48:17,646
Be gone with you. Go on.
Clear off.

1184
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:21,003
What this town needs, Alfrid,
is a good purge.

1185
01:48:21,240 --> 01:48:25,165
Starting with a certain troublemaker
who saw fit to question my authority.

1186
01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:28,131
- A certain bargeman, sire?
- Precisely.

1187
01:48:30,720 --> 01:48:31,721
No.

1188
01:48:31,960 --> 01:48:33,610
I'm done with Dwarves. Go away.

1189
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:35,488
No, no, no! Please!

1190
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:38,286
No one will help us. Kili's sick.

1191
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:41,961
He's very sick.

1192
01:49:21,320 --> 01:49:23,482
So quiet.

1193
01:49:23,720 --> 01:49:26,724
Wasn't always like this.

1194
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:32,126
Once, these slopes were lined with woodlands.

1195
01:49:32,360 --> 01:49:36,121
The trees were filled with birdsong.

1196
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:41,406
Relax, Master Baggins.

1197
01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:46,280
We have food, we have tools,
and we're making good time.

1198
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:01,290
What is this place?

1199
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:02,960
It was once the city of Dale.

1200
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:06,484
Now it is a ruin.

1201
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:09,447
The desolation of Smaug.

1202
01:50:09,680 --> 01:50:11,603
The sun will soon reach midday.

1203
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:14,335
We must find the hidden door
into the mountain before it sets.

1204
01:50:14,360 --> 01:50:15,360
This way.

1205
01:50:15,440 --> 01:50:17,488
Wait. Is this the overlook?

1206
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:19,165
Gandalf said to meet him here.

1207
01:50:19,400 --> 01:50:21,240
- On no account were we to...
- Do you see him?

1208
01:50:21,680 --> 01:50:24,011
We have no time to wait upon the Wizard.

1209
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:26,044
We're on our own. Come!

1210
01:50:43,160 --> 01:50:44,924
Dol Guldur.

1211
01:50:45,200 --> 01:50:47,362
The Hill of Sorcery.

1212
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:51,565
- It looks completely abandoned.
- As it is meant to.

1213
01:50:52,680 --> 01:50:55,992
A spell of concealment lies
over this place...

1214
01:50:56,752 --> 01:51:00,983
which means our Enemy is not
yet ready to reveal himself.

1215
01:51:02,640 --> 01:51:06,008
He has not regained his full strength.

1216
01:51:06,440 --> 01:51:09,808
Radagast, I need you to carry a message
to the Lady Galadriel.

1217
01:51:10,040 --> 01:51:12,247
Tell her we must force his hand.

1218
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:15,370
- What do you mean?
- I'm going in alone.

1219
01:51:15,720 --> 01:51:18,121
On no account come after me.

1220
01:51:24,280 --> 01:51:27,802
- Do I have your word?
- Yes, yes, yes, yes!

1221
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:41,010
Wait, Gandalf!

1222
01:51:42,160 --> 01:51:44,083
What if it's a trap?!

1223
01:51:44,920 --> 01:51:48,925
Turn around and do not come back.

1224
01:51:53,800 --> 01:51:56,644
It's undoubtedly a trap.

1225
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,883
- Anything?
- Nothing.

1226
01:52:46,440 --> 01:52:51,325
If the map is true the hidden
door lies directly above us.

1227
01:52:55,600 --> 01:52:57,489
Up here!

1228
01:53:05,640 --> 01:53:08,291
You have keen eyes, Mr. Baggins.

1229
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:10,882
Thrain?

1230
01:56:11,880 --> 01:56:14,360
Son of Thror?

1231
01:56:16,840 --> 01:56:18,490
My old friend.

1232
01:56:20,680 --> 01:56:22,808
Gandalf?

1233
01:56:29,560 --> 01:56:31,767
A lifetime.

1234
01:56:33,560 --> 01:56:37,246
I have been here a lifetime.

1235
01:56:37,480 --> 01:56:41,049
I'm so sorry I gave you up for dead.

1236
01:56:43,360 --> 01:56:45,931
I had a son.

1237
01:56:47,720 --> 01:56:49,404
I will fight with you.

1238
01:56:55,640 --> 01:56:56,640
Thorin.

1239
01:56:56,760 --> 01:56:59,969
And you will see him again, my friend.

1240
01:57:00,240 --> 01:57:02,288
Come, we must leave.

1241
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:04,921
The Orcs had taken Moria.

1242
01:57:05,200 --> 01:57:07,362
War. We were at war.

1243
01:57:09,720 --> 01:57:12,087
I was surrounded.

1244
01:57:14,360 --> 01:57:15,725
The Defiler.

1245
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:22,802
Azog the Defiler had come.

1246
01:58:10,600 --> 01:58:12,682
They took it.

1247
01:58:12,920 --> 01:58:15,127
The last of the seven.

1248
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:20,360
Come on, let's get you out of here.

1249
01:58:22,480 --> 01:58:23,480
There is no way out.

1250
01:58:24,520 --> 01:58:30,327
They will stop you.
The serpents will stop you.

1251
01:58:33,720 --> 01:58:34,721
It's an illusion.

1252
01:58:37,600 --> 01:58:39,489
Just an illusion.

1253
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:44,643
What have they done to you?

1254
01:58:44,920 --> 01:58:45,921
I never told them.

1255
01:58:46,160 --> 01:58:49,164
They tried to make me,
but I never said a word.

1256
01:58:51,880 --> 01:58:55,805
Have you kept them safe, Gandalf?
The map and the key?

1257
01:58:56,760 --> 01:58:57,921
I gave them to Thorin.

1258
01:58:58,400 --> 01:59:01,887
You'd be proud of him.
He's taken up the quest to reclaim Erebor.

1259
01:59:02,120 --> 01:59:03,203
Erebor.

1260
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:05,285
He will retrieve the Arkenstone.

1261
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:08,429
The seven armies of the Dwarves
will answer to a new king.

1262
01:59:08,455 --> 01:59:12,522
No, no. Thorin must not go near Erebor.

1263
01:59:13,400 --> 01:59:16,210
No one must enter that mountain.

1264
01:59:47,720 --> 01:59:48,801
This must be it.

1265
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:52,525
The hidden door.

1266
01:59:56,760 --> 02:00:01,045
Let all those who doubted us rue this day!

1267
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:09,206
Right, then. We have a key.

1268
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:14,931
Which means that somewhere
there is a key-hole.

1269
02:00:15,640 --> 02:00:18,530
"The last light of Durin's Day...

1270
02:00:20,520 --> 02:00:23,011
will shine upon the key-hole."

1271
02:00:32,160 --> 02:00:33,241
Nori.

1272
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:41,808
We're losing the light. Come on.

1273
02:00:48,320 --> 02:00:50,926
Be quiet! I can't hear when you're thumping.

1274
02:00:51,160 --> 02:00:52,160
I can't find it.

1275
02:00:53,400 --> 02:00:54,765
It's not here!

1276
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:56,081
It's not here!

1277
02:00:57,840 --> 02:00:59,200
- Break it down!
- Aye.

1278
02:01:00,920 --> 02:01:01,920
Come on!

1279
02:01:03,880 --> 02:01:04,642
Break!

1280
02:01:04,880 --> 02:01:05,881
It has to break.

1281
02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:08,171
It's no good.

1282
02:01:08,440 --> 02:01:10,920
The door's sealed.
Can't be opened by force.

1283
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:13,800
There's a powerful magic on it.

1284
02:01:23,320 --> 02:01:24,446
No!

1285
02:01:29,800 --> 02:01:32,087
"The last light of Durin's Day...

1286
02:01:33,960 --> 02:01:35,530
will shine upon the key-hole."

1287
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:41,564
That is what it says.

1288
02:01:46,040 --> 02:01:47,445
What did we miss?

1289
02:01:51,440 --> 02:01:52,885
What did we miss?

1290
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:57,249
- Balin?
- We've lost the light.

1291
02:01:59,760 --> 02:02:01,603
There's no more to be done.

1292
02:02:03,160 --> 02:02:05,240
We had but one chance.

1293
02:02:07,640 --> 02:02:10,969
Come away, lads.
It's over.

1294
02:02:12,040 --> 02:02:14,168
- Wait a minute.
- We're too late.

1295
02:02:16,680 --> 02:02:18,091
Where are they going?

1296
02:02:19,880 --> 02:02:21,769
You can't give up now!

1297
02:02:36,680 --> 02:02:37,841
Thorin.

1298
02:02:39,880 --> 02:02:41,564
You can't give up now.

1299
02:02:53,120 --> 02:02:55,487
"Stand by the gray stone...

1300
02:02:57,360 --> 02:02:59,442
when the thrush knocks."

1301
02:03:00,200 --> 02:03:01,611
The setting sun.

1302
02:03:02,640 --> 02:03:05,530
And "the last light
of Durin's Day will shine..."

1303
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:08,490
The last light.

1304
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:12,411
Last light.

1305
02:03:49,080 --> 02:03:50,320
The last light!

1306
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:01,686
The key-hole!

1307
02:04:02,200 --> 02:04:03,200
Come back!

1308
02:04:03,560 --> 02:04:04,891
Come back!

1309
02:04:05,160 --> 02:04:09,043
It's the light of the moon!
The last moon of autumn!

1310
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:14,961
Where's the key? Where's the key?
Where's the...?

1311
02:04:15,200 --> 02:04:16,929
It was here.

1312
02:04:17,160 --> 02:04:18,969
Come on, it was... It was here.

1313
02:04:19,680 --> 02:04:20,680
It was just...

1314
02:05:18,520 --> 02:05:19,965
Erebor.

1315
02:05:20,680 --> 02:05:21,806
Thorin.

1316
02:05:35,200 --> 02:05:37,089
I know these walls.

1317
02:05:40,840 --> 02:05:42,365
These halls.

1318
02:05:45,360 --> 02:05:46,771
This stone.

1319
02:05:50,680 --> 02:05:52,686
You remember it, Balin.

1320
02:05:56,280 --> 02:05:58,806
Chambers filled with golden light.

1321
02:06:00,680 --> 02:06:02,170
I remember.

1322
02:06:15,440 --> 02:06:19,821
"Herein lies the Seventh
Kingdom of Durin's Folk.

1323
02:06:22,280 --> 02:06:29,407
May the Heart of the Mountain unite
all Dwarves in defense of this home."

1324
02:06:30,920 --> 02:06:32,763
The Throne of the King.

1325
02:06:36,480 --> 02:06:39,802
And what's that above it?

1326
02:06:43,360 --> 02:06:45,089
The Arkenstone.

1327
02:06:46,400 --> 02:06:47,811
Arkenstone.

1328
02:06:51,720 --> 02:06:53,085
And what's that?

1329
02:06:53,400 --> 02:06:56,370
That, Master Burglar...

1330
02:06:57,400 --> 02:06:59,448
is why you are here.

1331
02:07:18,320 --> 02:07:20,049
Can you not do something?

1332
02:07:20,280 --> 02:07:22,521
I need herbs.
Something to bring down his fever.

1333
02:07:22,760 --> 02:07:25,127
I have nightshade. I have feverfew.

1334
02:07:25,400 --> 02:07:28,210
They're no use to me.
Do you have any kingsfoil?

1335
02:07:28,440 --> 02:07:30,442
No, it's a weed.
We feed it to the pigs.

1336
02:07:30,880 --> 02:07:32,006
Pigs?

1337
02:07:32,280 --> 02:07:33,406
Weed.

1338
02:07:34,160 --> 02:07:35,286
Right.

1339
02:07:36,240 --> 02:07:37,401
Don't move.

1340
02:07:40,200 --> 02:07:43,727
You want me to find a jewel?

1341
02:07:45,280 --> 02:07:47,009
A large, white jewel.

1342
02:07:47,440 --> 02:07:48,566
Yes.

1343
02:07:49,960 --> 02:07:52,531
That's it? Only, I imagine
there's quite a few down there.

1344
02:07:52,880 --> 02:07:58,922
There is only one Arkenstone
and you'll know it when you see it.

1345
02:08:00,040 --> 02:08:01,166
Right.

1346
02:08:04,920 --> 02:08:06,647
In truth lad...

1347
02:08:07,440 --> 02:08:11,802
I do not know what you
will find down there.

1348
02:08:13,920 --> 02:08:17,083
You needn't go if you don't want to.
There's no dishonor in turning back.

1349
02:08:17,320 --> 02:08:18,320
No, Balin.

1350
02:08:19,520 --> 02:08:23,969
I promised I would do this
and I think I must try.

1351
02:08:28,640 --> 02:08:30,369
It never ceases to amaze me.

1352
02:08:30,600 --> 02:08:33,364
- What's that?
- The courage of Hobbits.

1353
02:08:35,760 --> 02:08:37,000
Go now...

1354
02:08:37,520 --> 02:08:41,525
with as much luck as you can muster.

1355
02:08:48,720 --> 02:08:50,006
Oh, Bilbo?

1356
02:08:52,440 --> 02:08:58,110
If there is, in fact a...
live dragon down there...

1357
02:09:01,400 --> 02:09:02,811
don't waken it.

1358
02:09:22,840 --> 02:09:25,081
He is waiting for them.

1359
02:09:25,360 --> 02:09:26,600
They are in league.

1360
02:09:26,840 --> 02:09:29,923
The dragon and the One.

1361
02:09:30,160 --> 02:09:31,571
Hurry. We must hurry.

1362
02:09:54,040 --> 02:09:55,485
Where is your master?

1363
02:09:57,280 --> 02:09:58,361
Where is he?!

1364
02:10:53,680 --> 02:10:55,250
He is here.

1365
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:03,402
Tell Thorin, that I loved him.

1366
02:11:03,640 --> 02:11:08,721
Will you do that?
Will you tell my son that I loved him?

1367
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,128
You will tell him yourself.

1368
02:11:12,920 --> 02:11:14,570
It is too late.

1369
02:12:38,160 --> 02:12:40,970
Sauron!

1370
02:13:03,560 --> 02:13:04,641
Hello?

1371
02:13:23,680 --> 02:13:25,091
He's not at home.

1372
02:13:26,040 --> 02:13:27,324
Not at home.

1373
02:13:28,560 --> 02:13:29,641
Good.

1374
02:13:31,440 --> 02:13:33,169
Good, good, good.

1375
02:14:27,894 --> 02:14:29,029
What's that?

1376
02:14:35,320 --> 02:14:36,606
Arkenstone.

1377
02:14:37,640 --> 02:14:39,051
Arkenstone.

1378
02:14:39,880 --> 02:14:41,928
A large, white jewel.

1379
02:14:44,120 --> 02:14:45,485
Very helpful.

1380
02:17:11,080 --> 02:17:12,491
Well...

1381
02:17:14,160 --> 02:17:15,446
thief.

1382
02:17:17,440 --> 02:17:21,081
I smell you.

1383
02:17:21,440 --> 02:17:24,649
I hear your breath.

1384
02:17:25,960 --> 02:17:28,762
I feel your air.

1385
02:17:32,680 --> 02:17:35,206
Where are you?

1386
02:17:36,680 --> 02:17:37,761
Where are you?

1387
02:17:57,880 --> 02:17:59,481
Come, now...

1388
02:17:59,640 --> 02:18:01,768
don't be shy.

1389
02:18:02,040 --> 02:18:04,247
Step into the light.

1390
02:18:11,160 --> 02:18:14,369
There is something about you.

1391
02:18:17,760 --> 02:18:19,642
Something you carry.

1392
02:18:20,800 --> 02:18:23,690
Something made of gold.

1393
02:18:24,440 --> 02:18:29,409
But far more precious.

1394
02:18:29,640 --> 02:18:31,961
<i>Precious! Precious!</i>

1395
02:18:34,760 --> 02:18:35,921
There you are...

1396
02:18:36,200 --> 02:18:39,803
Thief in the Shadows.

1397
02:18:41,640 --> 02:18:44,246
I did not come to steal from you...

1398
02:18:44,480 --> 02:18:47,963
O Smaug, the Unassessably Wealthy.

1399
02:18:48,063 --> 02:18:50,949
I merely wanted to gaze
upon your magnificence.

1400
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:55,050
To see if you really were
as great as the old tales say.

1401
02:18:55,760 --> 02:18:57,489
I did not believe them.

1402
02:19:06,320 --> 02:19:10,245
And do you now?!

1403
02:19:11,600 --> 02:19:12,840
Truly...

1404
02:19:14,160 --> 02:19:20,211
the tales and songs fall utterly
short of your enormity...

1405
02:19:20,440 --> 02:19:23,410
O Smaug the Stupendous.

1406
02:19:23,640 --> 02:19:26,530
Do you think flattery will keep you alive?

1407
02:19:27,040 --> 02:19:29,730
- No, no.
- No, indeed.

1408
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:38,370
You seem familiar with my name but I don't
remember smelling your kind before.

1409
02:19:39,480 --> 02:19:43,846
Who are you and where
do you come from...

1410
02:19:44,080 --> 02:19:46,401
may I ask?

1411
02:19:55,960 --> 02:19:57,644
I come from under the hill.

1412
02:19:58,000 --> 02:19:59,411
Underhill?

1413
02:20:03,120 --> 02:20:04,120
And under hills...

1414
02:20:04,240 --> 02:20:06,242
and over hills my path has led.

1415
02:20:07,120 --> 02:20:11,087
And through the air.
I am he who walks unseen.

1416
02:20:11,320 --> 02:20:13,049
Impressive.

1417
02:20:13,280 --> 02:20:15,328
What else do you claim to be?

1418
02:20:16,280 --> 02:20:17,280
I am...

1419
02:20:20,320 --> 02:20:21,810
Luck-wearer.

1420
02:20:23,240 --> 02:20:24,401
Riddle-maker.

1421
02:20:24,680 --> 02:20:28,201
Lovely titles.
Go on.

1422
02:20:28,480 --> 02:20:29,561
Barrel-rider.

1423
02:20:29,800 --> 02:20:33,202
Barrels? Now that is interesting.

1424
02:20:34,680 --> 02:20:38,610
And what about your little Dwarf friends?

1425
02:20:39,720 --> 02:20:42,272
Where are they hiding?

1426
02:20:43,840 --> 02:20:45,410
Dwarves?

1427
02:20:46,240 --> 02:20:47,321
No.

1428
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:49,525
No, no. No Dwarves here.

1429
02:20:49,760 --> 02:20:50,841
You've got that all wrong.

1430
02:20:51,120 --> 02:20:54,886
Oh, I don't think so, Barrel-rider!

1431
02:20:55,440 --> 02:21:01,781
They sent you in here to do their dirty
work while they skulk about outside.

1432
02:21:02,360 --> 02:21:08,964
Truly you are mistaken. O Smaug,
Chiefest and Greatest of Calamities.

1433
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:12,402
You have nice manners...

1434
02:21:12,640 --> 02:21:15,762
for a thief and a liar!

1435
02:21:17,120 --> 02:21:20,522
I know the smell and taste of Dwarf.

1436
02:21:20,960 --> 02:21:22,166
No one better!

1437
02:21:23,880 --> 02:21:25,291
It is the gold!

1438
02:21:25,520 --> 02:21:29,370
They are drawn to treasure
like flies to dead flesh.

1439
02:21:32,920 --> 02:21:36,190
Did you think I did not
know this day would come?!

1440
02:21:37,960 --> 02:21:45,160
That a pack of canting Dwarves would come
crawling back to the mountain?!

1441
02:21:49,720 --> 02:21:50,926
Was that an earthquake?

1442
02:21:51,160 --> 02:21:53,288
That, my lad...

1443
02:21:56,520 --> 02:21:57,965
was a dragon.

1444
02:22:06,280 --> 02:22:07,280
Da?

1445
02:22:07,360 --> 02:22:08,964
It's coming from the mountain.

1446
02:22:13,040 --> 02:22:14,280
You should leave us.

1447
02:22:14,560 --> 02:22:15,320
Take your children.

1448
02:22:15,440 --> 02:22:16,440
Get out of here.

1449
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:18,286
And go where?

1450
02:22:19,360 --> 02:22:20,771
There is nowhere to go.

1451
02:22:22,720 --> 02:22:24,245
Are we going to die, Da?

1452
02:22:26,280 --> 02:22:27,441
No, darling.

1453
02:22:27,720 --> 02:22:30,005
The dragon.
It's going to kill us.

1454
02:22:40,680 --> 02:22:42,489
Not if I kill it first.

1455
02:22:43,920 --> 02:22:49,524
The King Under the Mountain is dead.
I took his throne.

1456
02:22:49,880 --> 02:22:53,845
I ate his people like a wolf among sheep.

1457
02:22:57,600 --> 02:23:02,365
I kill where I wish, when I wish.

1458
02:23:02,600 --> 02:23:05,922
My armor is iron.

1459
02:23:15,080 --> 02:23:17,526
No blade can pierce me.

1460
02:23:20,680 --> 02:23:21,920
All right.

1461
02:23:22,160 --> 02:23:24,527
A Black Arrow?
Why did you never tell me?

1462
02:23:24,760 --> 02:23:26,410
Because you did not need to know.

1463
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:35,525
Listen to me carefully.

1464
02:23:35,880 --> 02:23:38,042
I need you to distract the guards.

1465
02:23:38,600 --> 02:23:41,727
Once I'm at the top of the tower,
I'll set the arrow to the bow.

1466
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:42,760
There he is!

1467
02:23:42,840 --> 02:23:43,409
Bard!

1468
02:23:43,640 --> 02:23:45,847
- After him!
- Quickly! Down there. Go!

1469
02:23:46,080 --> 02:23:47,080
Stop him!

1470
02:23:54,120 --> 02:23:55,120
Stop him!

1471
02:23:55,840 --> 02:23:56,840
Stop!

1472
02:24:00,600 --> 02:24:02,250
Bain! Bain.

1473
02:24:03,080 --> 02:24:06,766
Keep it safe. Don't let anyone find it.
I'll deal with them.

1474
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:08,729
- I'm not leaving you.
- Now go!

1475
02:24:12,680 --> 02:24:13,329
Braga.

1476
02:24:13,560 --> 02:24:14,415
You're under arrest.

1477
02:24:14,440 --> 02:24:17,330
- On what charge?
- Any charge the Master chooses.

1478
02:24:47,320 --> 02:24:48,731
Where's he gone?

1479
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:01,081
What about Bilbo?

1480
02:25:01,320 --> 02:25:02,321
Give him more time.

1481
02:25:02,560 --> 02:25:04,722
Time to do what? To be killed?

1482
02:25:07,200 --> 02:25:08,440
You're afraid.

1483
02:25:10,120 --> 02:25:12,407
Yes, I'm afraid.

1484
02:25:13,560 --> 02:25:14,925
I fear for you.

1485
02:25:16,280 --> 02:25:18,442
A sickness lies upon that treasure hoard.

1486
02:25:18,880 --> 02:25:21,206
A sickness which drove
your grandfather mad.

1487
02:25:21,480 --> 02:25:25,044
- I am not my grandfather.
- You're not yourself.

1488
02:25:25,920 --> 02:25:28,048
The Thorin I know would not
hesitate to go in there...

1489
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:32,920
I will not risk this quest
for the life of one burglar.

1490
02:25:34,800 --> 02:25:36,245
Bilbo.

1491
02:25:36,600 --> 02:25:38,523
His name is Bilbo.

1492
02:25:42,280 --> 02:25:44,089
It's Oakenshield...

1493
02:25:44,360 --> 02:25:47,330
that filthy Dwarvish usurper.

1494
02:25:49,560 --> 02:25:54,725
He sent you in here
for the Arkenstone, didn't he?

1495
02:25:54,960 --> 02:25:58,730
No. No, no.
I don't know what you're talking about.

1496
02:25:58,960 --> 02:26:00,086
Don't bother denying it.

1497
02:26:01,480 --> 02:26:03,289
I guessed his foul purpose some time ago.

1498
02:26:05,880 --> 02:26:11,007
But it matters not.
Oakenshield's quest will fail.

1499
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:14,764
The darkness is coming.

1500
02:26:15,600 --> 02:26:19,605
It will spread to every corner of the land.

1501
02:27:02,200 --> 02:27:09,366
You are being used, Thief in the Shadows.
You were only ever a means to an end.

1502
02:27:10,200 --> 02:27:17,882
The coward, Oakenshield, has weighed the value
of your life and found it worth nothing.

1503
02:27:18,480 --> 02:27:19,686
No.

1504
02:27:20,400 --> 02:27:21,400
No.

1505
02:27:22,360 --> 02:27:23,360
No, you're lying.

1506
02:27:23,600 --> 02:27:27,282
What did he promise you?
A share of the treasure?

1507
02:27:28,280 --> 02:27:30,761
As if it was his to give.

1508
02:27:31,600 --> 02:27:37,806
I will not part with a single coin.
Not one piece of it.

1509
02:27:41,680 --> 02:27:48,202
My teeth are swords.
My claws are spears.

1510
02:27:50,320 --> 02:27:54,646
My wings are a hurricane.

1511
02:28:00,280 --> 02:28:04,642
So it is true.
The Black Arrow found its mark.

1512
02:28:04,880 --> 02:28:06,302
What did you say?

1513
02:28:06,640 --> 02:28:11,966
I was just saying your reputation
precedes you, O Smaug the Tyrannical.

1514
02:28:12,560 --> 02:28:15,848
Truly. You have no equal on this earth.

1515
02:28:20,280 --> 02:28:28,127
I am almost tempted to let you take it.
If only to see Oakenshield suffer.

1516
02:28:29,200 --> 02:28:37,200
Watch it destroy him.
Watch it corrupt his heart and drive him mad.

1517
02:28:41,920 --> 02:28:46,321
But I think not.
I think our little game ends here.

1518
02:28:47,160 --> 02:28:49,567
So tell me, thief.

1519
02:28:50,440 --> 02:28:52,568
How do you choose to die?

1520
02:30:05,200 --> 02:30:07,248
Da? Is that you, Da?

1521
02:30:40,560 --> 02:30:41,691
Stay down!

1522
02:31:42,520 --> 02:31:43,520
Get down!

1523
02:32:19,720 --> 02:32:20,881
You killed them all.

1524
02:32:21,120 --> 02:32:22,120
There are others.

1525
02:32:22,640 --> 02:32:23,721
Tauriel.

1526
02:32:24,200 --> 02:32:25,326
Come.

1527
02:32:29,360 --> 02:32:30,360
We're losing him.

1528
02:32:34,240 --> 02:32:35,446
Tauriel.

1529
02:32:59,360 --> 02:33:00,361
Athelas.

1530
02:33:03,200 --> 02:33:04,645
Athelas.

1531
02:33:05,640 --> 02:33:06,721
What are you doing?

1532
02:33:09,720 --> 02:33:11,449
I'm going to save him.

1533
02:33:32,200 --> 02:33:33,735
- You're alive!
- Not for much longer.

1534
02:33:33,760 --> 02:33:36,730
- Did you find the Arkenstone?
- The dragon's coming.

1535
02:33:39,680 --> 02:33:41,250
Did you find it?

1536
02:33:46,760 --> 02:33:47,841
We have to get out.

1537
02:33:51,560 --> 02:33:52,561
Thorin.

1538
02:33:56,280 --> 02:33:57,406
Thorin.

1539
02:34:27,840 --> 02:34:29,968
You will burn!

1540
02:34:31,120 --> 02:34:32,120
Run!

1541
02:34:39,120 --> 02:34:40,201
Come on, Bilbo!

1542
02:34:53,080 --> 02:34:54,127
Come on.

1543
02:35:11,280 --> 02:35:12,486
Hold him down.

1544
02:35:29,580 --> 02:35:30,609
Tilda.

1545
02:36:32,520 --> 02:36:33,965
We've given him the slip.

1546
02:36:34,200 --> 02:36:35,201
No.

1547
02:36:35,680 --> 02:36:37,887
He's too cunning for that.

1548
02:36:39,640 --> 02:36:42,691
- So where to now?
- The western guardroom.

1549
02:36:43,400 --> 02:36:46,281
- There may be a way out.
- It's too high.

1550
02:36:46,307 --> 02:36:49,547
- There's no chance that way.
- It's our only chance.

1551
02:36:50,840 --> 02:36:52,330
We have to try.

1552
02:37:08,880 --> 02:37:10,041
Come on.

1553
02:37:57,560 --> 02:38:01,326
I've heard tell of the wonders
of Elvish medicine.

1554
02:38:01,560 --> 02:38:04,291
That was a privilege to witness.

1555
02:38:06,760 --> 02:38:07,921
Tauriel.

1556
02:38:12,240 --> 02:38:13,446
Lie still.

1557
02:38:20,640 --> 02:38:22,768
You cannot be her.

1558
02:38:26,240 --> 02:38:28,402
She is far away.

1559
02:38:32,600 --> 02:38:35,844
She is far, far away from me.

1560
02:38:37,480 --> 02:38:42,525
She walks in starlight in another world.

1561
02:38:47,840 --> 02:38:49,808
It was just a dream.

1562
02:39:01,480 --> 02:39:03,721
Do you think she could've loved me?

1563
02:39:11,040 --> 02:39:12,200
Stay close.

1564
02:39:22,440 --> 02:39:23,700
That's it, then.

1565
02:39:24,480 --> 02:39:26,323
There's no way out.

1566
02:39:32,720 --> 02:39:34,961
The last of our kin.

1567
02:39:38,640 --> 02:39:40,722
They must have come here...

1568
02:39:41,400 --> 02:39:43,841
hoping beyond hope.

1569
02:39:53,600 --> 02:39:59,001
We could try to reach the mines.
We might last a few days.

1570
02:40:01,160 --> 02:40:02,207
No.

1571
02:40:05,160 --> 02:40:07,401
I will not die like this.

1572
02:40:08,760 --> 02:40:12,609
Cowering.
Clawing for breath.

1573
02:40:17,520 --> 02:40:18,646
We make for the forges.

1574
02:40:18,920 --> 02:40:22,360
- He'll see us, sure as death.
- Not if we split up.

1575
02:40:22,600 --> 02:40:23,640
Thorin...

1576
02:40:23,840 --> 02:40:27,285
- we'll never make it.
- Some of us might.

1577
02:40:27,480 --> 02:40:29,721
Lead him to the forges.

1578
02:40:30,480 --> 02:40:32,482
We kill the dragon.

1579
02:40:34,200 --> 02:40:39,321
If this is to end in fire then
we will all burn together.

1580
02:40:40,640 --> 02:40:41,801
This way.

1581
02:40:46,280 --> 02:40:47,280
Flee.

1582
02:40:47,960 --> 02:40:48,960
Flee.

1583
02:40:49,880 --> 02:40:51,848
Run for your lives.

1584
02:40:52,600 --> 02:40:56,327
There is nowhere to hide.

1585
02:40:56,560 --> 02:40:57,560
Behind you!

1586
02:40:59,760 --> 02:41:00,760
Come on!

1587
02:41:02,800 --> 02:41:03,847
Run!

1588
02:41:05,800 --> 02:41:07,086
Hey, you!

1589
02:41:07,440 --> 02:41:08,440
Here!

1590
02:44:06,160 --> 02:44:08,128
This way. It's this way!

1591
02:44:08,400 --> 02:44:09,526
Come on!

1592
02:44:09,760 --> 02:44:10,760
Thorin!

1593
02:44:16,120 --> 02:44:17,246
Follow Balin!

1594
02:44:18,440 --> 02:44:19,680
- Thorin.
- Come on!

1595
02:44:35,520 --> 02:44:36,885
Thorin!

1596
02:44:45,960 --> 02:44:47,007
Hold on!

1597
02:45:20,840 --> 02:45:22,171
Thorin!

1598
02:45:25,040 --> 02:45:26,610
Go. Go!

1599
02:45:30,320 --> 02:45:34,006
The plan's not gonna work.
These furnaces are stone cold.

1600
02:45:34,240 --> 02:45:38,161
He's right. We've no fire hot
enough to set them ablaze.

1601
02:45:40,720 --> 02:45:42,085
Have we not?

1602
02:45:43,640 --> 02:45:46,564
I did not look to see you so easily outwitted.

1603
02:45:50,520 --> 02:45:56,378
You have grown slow
and fat in your dotage...

1604
02:45:57,520 --> 02:45:58,681
slug!

1605
02:46:00,080 --> 02:46:01,764
Take cover. Go!

1606
02:46:29,200 --> 02:46:29,883
Bombur!

1607
02:46:30,200 --> 02:46:31,611
Get those bellows working.

1608
02:46:31,840 --> 02:46:32,966
Go!

1609
02:46:47,160 --> 02:46:51,311
Bilbo! Up there.
On my mark pull that lever.

1610
02:47:01,400 --> 02:47:03,721
Balin! Can you still mix a flash-flame?

1611
02:47:03,960 --> 02:47:06,361
Aye. It'll only take a jiffy. Come on!

1612
02:47:08,120 --> 02:47:09,565
We don't have a jiffy.

1613
02:47:21,520 --> 02:47:22,646
Where's the sulfur?

1614
02:47:23,040 --> 02:47:24,803
You sure you know
what you're doing?

1615
02:47:36,560 --> 02:47:37,560
Come on!

1616
02:47:59,640 --> 02:48:00,640
Now!

1617
02:49:57,080 --> 02:49:59,162
Lead him to the Gallery of the Kings.

1618
02:50:47,240 --> 02:50:48,241
Keep going, Bilbo!

1619
02:50:48,800 --> 02:50:49,881
Run!

1620
02:51:35,200 --> 02:51:38,408
You think you can deceive me, Barrel-rider?

1621
02:51:41,960 --> 02:51:44,964
You have come from Lake-town.

1622
02:51:46,680 --> 02:51:51,396
This is some sordid scheme hatched
between these filthy Dwarves...

1623
02:51:51,422 --> 02:51:54,442
and those miserable
tub-trading Lakemen.

1624
02:51:55,880 --> 02:51:57,803
Those sniveling cowards...

1625
02:51:58,040 --> 02:52:02,604
with their long bows and Black Arrows.

1626
02:52:02,960 --> 02:52:07,009
Perhaps it is time I paid them a visit.

1627
02:52:07,520 --> 02:52:08,760
Oh, no.

1628
02:52:10,640 --> 02:52:12,130
This isn't their fault!

1629
02:52:12,360 --> 02:52:13,368
Wait!

1630
02:52:13,400 --> 02:52:15,004
You cannot go to Lake-town!

1631
02:52:16,920 --> 02:52:21,040
You care about them, do you?

1632
02:52:21,280 --> 02:52:22,347
Good.

1633
02:52:22,960 --> 02:52:25,370
Then you can watch them die.

1634
02:52:30,920 --> 02:52:32,046
Here!

1635
02:52:32,960 --> 02:52:35,236
You witless worm!

1636
02:52:40,800 --> 02:52:42,511
You.

1637
02:52:42,600 --> 02:52:45,080
I am taking back what you stole.

1638
02:52:49,120 --> 02:52:53,530
You will take nothing from me...

1639
02:52:53,800 --> 02:52:54,961
Dwarf.

1640
02:52:55,740 --> 02:53:00,764
I laid low your warriors of old.

1641
02:53:00,840 --> 02:53:05,124
I instilled terror in the hearts of Men.

1642
02:53:06,280 --> 02:53:11,859
I am King Under the Mountain.

1643
02:53:12,080 --> 02:53:16,602
This is not your kingdom.
These are Dwarf lands.

1644
02:53:17,360 --> 02:53:18,360
This is Dwarf gold.

1645
02:53:20,680 --> 02:53:23,802
And we will have our revenge.

1646
02:54:45,360 --> 02:54:46,360
Revenge?!

1647
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:49,650
Revenge?!

1648
02:54:50,440 --> 02:54:55,525
I will show you revenge!

1649
02:55:32,140 --> 02:55:33,187
Listen to me!

1650
02:55:33,440 --> 02:55:35,727
Do you not know what is coming?

1651
02:55:38,160 --> 02:55:41,881
I am fire.

1652
02:55:43,080 --> 02:55:45,560
I am...

1653
02:55:47,800 --> 02:55:49,131
death.

1654
02:55:58,140 --> 02:56:00,347
What have we done?
