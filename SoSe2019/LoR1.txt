1
00:00:34,536 --> 00:00:37,622
<i>The world is changed.</i>

2
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:40,792
<i>I feel it in the water.</i>

3
00:00:41,543 --> 00:00:44,462
<i>I feel it in the earth.</i>

4
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:49,050
<i>I smell it in the air.</i>

5
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:51,344
<i>Much that once was...</i>

6
00:00:51,553 --> 00:00:53,137
<i>...is lost.</i>

7
00:00:53,805 --> 00:00:56,849
<i>For none now live who remember it.</i>

8
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:14,158
<i>It began with the forging
of the Great Rings.</i>

9
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:16,327
<i>Three were given to the Elves:</i>

10
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:20,290
<i>Immortal, wisest and fairest
of all beings.</i>

11
00:01:21,332 --> 00:01:23,418
<i>Seven to the Dwarf-lords:</i>

12
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:28,590
<i>Great miners and craftsmen
of the mountain halls.</i>

13
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:30,300
<i>And nine...</i>

14
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:33,511
<i>...nine rings were gifted
to the race of Men...</i>

15
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,557
<i>...who, above all else, desire power.</i>

16
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:43,896
<i>For within these rings was bound
the strength and will to govern each race.</i>

17
00:01:45,398 --> 00:01:48,568
<i>But they were all of them deceived.</i>

18
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:50,903
<i>For another ring was made.</i>

19
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,325
<i>In the land of Mordor,
in the fires of Mount Doom...</i>

20
00:01:55,742 --> 00:02:00,204
<i>...the Dark Lord Sauron forged
in secret a Master Ring...</i>

21
00:02:00,413 --> 00:02:02,457
<i>...to control all others.</i>

22
00:02:02,665 --> 00:02:06,628
<i>And into this Ring he poured
his cruelty, his malice...</i>

23
00:02:06,836 --> 00:02:11,049
<i>...and his will to dominate all life.</i>

24
00:02:12,008 --> 00:02:15,887
<i>One Ring to rule them all.</i>

25
00:02:16,721 --> 00:02:18,389
<i>One by one...</i>

26
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:23,269
<i>...the Free Lands of Middle-earth
fell to the power of the Ring.</i>

27
00:02:23,478 --> 00:02:26,522
<i>But there were some who resisted.</i>

28
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:31,653
<i>A Last Alliance of Men and Elves
marched against the armies of Mordor.</i>

29
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:36,491
<i>And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they
fought for the freedom of Middle-earth.</i>

30
00:03:06,813 --> 00:03:09,440
<i>Victory was near.</i>

31
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:15,947
<i>But the power of the Ring...</i>

32
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:18,199
<i>...could not be undone.</i>

33
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:44,726
<i>It was in this moment...</i>

34
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:47,311
<i>...when all hope had faded...</i>

35
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,649
<i>...that Isildur, son of the king,
took up his father's sword.</i>

36
00:04:22,722 --> 00:04:29,228
<i>Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples
of Middle-earth, was defeated.</i>

37
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,279
<i>The Ring passed to Isildur...</i>

38
00:04:38,488 --> 00:04:42,700
<i>...who had this one chance
to destroy evil forever.</i>

39
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:45,536
<i>But the hearts of Men...</i>

40
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:48,247
<i>...are easily corrupted.</i>

41
00:04:48,498 --> 00:04:53,127
<i>And the Ring of Power
has a will of its own.</i>

42
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,947
<i>It betrayed Isildur...</i>

43
00:05:22,782 --> 00:05:25,201
<i>...to his death.</i>

44
00:05:29,372 --> 00:05:33,251
<i>And some things
that should not have been forgotten...</i>

45
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:35,795
<i>...were lost.</i>

46
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:38,840
<i>History became legend...</i>

47
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:41,050
<i>...legend became myth.</i>

48
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:44,136
<i>And for
two and a half thousand years...</i>

49
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:48,015
<i>...the Ring passed
out of all knowledge.</i>

50
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:51,477
<i>Until, when chance came...</i>

51
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:55,273
<i>...it ensnared a new bearer.</i>

52
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:01,445
My precious.

53
00:06:01,696 --> 00:06:04,240
<i>The Ring came
to the creature Gollum...</i>

54
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:08,327
<i>...who took it deep into the tunnels
of the Misty Mountains.</i>

55
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:11,497
<i>And there it consumed him.</i>

56
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,791
It came to me.

57
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,421
My own. My love. My own.

58
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:23,342
My precious.

59
00:06:26,971 --> 00:06:30,391
<i>The Ring brought
to Gollum unnatural long life.</i>

60
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,437
<i>For 500 years it poisoned his mind.</i>

61
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:39,233
<i>And in the gloom of Gollum's cave,
it waited.</i>

62
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:42,695
<i>Darkness crept back
into the forests of the world.</i>

63
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:45,781
<i>Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...</i>

64
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,784
<i>...whispers of a nameless fear.</i>

65
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:52,288
<i>And the Ring of Power perceived...</i>

66
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:55,291
<i>...its time had now come.</i>

67
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,379
<i>It abandoned Gollum.</i>

68
00:07:01,047 --> 00:07:05,551
<i>But something happened then
the Ring did not intend.</i>

69
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:10,973
<i>It was picked up by the most unlikely
creature imaginable.</i>

70
00:07:11,182 --> 00:07:12,224
What's this?

71
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:13,893
<i>A Hobbit.</i>

72
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,812
<i>Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.</i>

73
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:18,773
A ring.

74
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:20,858
Lost!

75
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:27,073
My precious is lost!

76
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,575
<i>For the time will soon come...</i>

77
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:34,997
<i>...when Hobbits will shape
the fortunes of all.</i>

78
00:07:39,752 --> 00:07:42,838
The 22nd day of September...

79
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:44,215
...in the year 1400...

80
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:48,052
...by Shire-reckoning.

81
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:54,141
Bag End, Bagshot Row, Hobbiton,
Westfarthing...

82
00:07:55,518 --> 00:07:56,894
...the Shire...

83
00:07:57,061 --> 00:07:59,897
...Middle-earth.

84
00:08:04,527 --> 00:08:07,863
The Third Age of this world.

85
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:23,421
<i>There and Back Again:</i>

86
00:08:23,963 --> 00:08:25,798
<i>A Hobbit's Tale.</i>

87
00:08:25,965 --> 00:08:28,467
By Bilbo Baggins.

88
00:08:34,724 --> 00:08:36,475
Now...

89
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:39,186
...where to begin?

90
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,522
Ah, yes...

91
00:08:45,985 --> 00:08:47,695
"Concerning...

92
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:50,531
...Hobbits."

93
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:55,202
<i>Hobbits have been living and farming
in the four Farthings of the Shire...</i>

94
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,371
<i>...for many hundreds of years...</i>

95
00:08:57,538 --> 00:09:00,499
<i>...quite content to ignore
and be ignored...</i>

96
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,878
<i>...by the world of the Big Folk.</i>

97
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:09,884
<i>Middle-earth being, after all,
full of strange creatures beyond count...</i>

98
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:13,220
<i>...Hobbits must seem
of little importance...</i>

99
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:17,433
<i>...being neither renowned
as great warriors...</i>

100
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,812
<i>...nor counted among the very wise.</i>

101
00:09:26,192 --> 00:09:29,195
Frodo! Someone at the door.

102
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:32,948
<i>In fact, it has been remarked by some...</i>

103
00:09:33,199 --> 00:09:37,661
<i>...that Hobbits' only real passion
is for food.</i>

104
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:40,206
<i>A rather unfair observation...</i>

105
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:44,085
<i>...as we have also developed a keen
interest in the brewing of ales...</i>

106
00:09:44,502 --> 00:09:47,213
<i>...and the smoking of pipe-weed.</i>

107
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:50,508
<i>But where our hearts truly lie...</i>

108
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:52,843
<i>...is in peace and quiet...</i>

109
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:55,679
<i>...and good, tilled earth.</i>

110
00:09:55,846 --> 00:10:01,060
<i>For all Hobbits share a love
of things that grow.</i>

111
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:08,609
<i>And, yes, no doubt to others,
our ways seem quaint.</i>

112
00:10:08,818 --> 00:10:14,031
<i>But today of all days,
it is brought home to me:</i>

113
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:20,496
<i>It is no bad thing
to celebrate a simple life.</i>

114
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,878
Frodo, the door!

115
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:32,925
Sticklebacks. Where is that boy?

116
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:35,553
Frodo!

117
00:10:41,392 --> 00:10:44,895
<i>Down from the door where it began</i>

118
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:53,404
<i>And I must follow if I can</i>

119
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:58,492
<i>The road goes ever on and on</i>

120
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:02,246
<i>Down from the door where it began</i>

121
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:07,376
<i>Now far ahead the road has gone</i>

122
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:11,797
<i>- And I must follow if I can</i>
- You're late.

123
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:18,888
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.

124
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:24,310
Nor is he early. He arrives
precisely when he means to.

125
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:38,782
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

126
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:46,332
You didn't think I'd miss
your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?

127
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,169
How is the old rascal?

128
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:54,215
I hear it's going to be a party
of special magnificence.

129
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:56,842
You know Bilbo.
He's got the whole place in an uproar.

130
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:59,011
Well, that should please him.

131
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:01,013
Half the Shire's been invited.

132
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:03,933
And the rest of them are turning up
anyway.

133
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:10,397
<i>And so life in the Shire goes on...</i>

134
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:13,651
<i>...very much as it has
this past Age...</i>

135
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:19,365
<i>...full of its own comings and goings,
with change coming slowly.</i>

136
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,450
<i>If it comes at all.</i>

137
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:26,163
<i>For things are made to endure
in the Shire...</i>

138
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:29,833
<i>...passing from one generation
to the next.</i>

139
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:35,214
<i>There's always been a Baggins
living here under the Hill...</i>

140
00:12:35,381 --> 00:12:36,715
<i>...in Bag End.</i>

141
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,346
And there always will be.

142
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:46,392
To tell you the truth,
Bilbo's been a bit odd lately.

143
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:50,020
I mean, more than usual.

144
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:52,982
He's taken to locking himself
in his study.

145
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:58,696
<i>He spends hours poring over old maps
when he thinks I'm not looking.</i>

146
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,043
Where's it gone?

147
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,905
He's up to something.

148
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:52,541
- All right, then. Keep your secrets.
- What?

149
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,418
But I know you have something
to do with it.

150
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:55,753
Good gracious me.

151
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:58,255
Before you came along, we Bagginses
were very well thought of.

152
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:00,090
Indeed.

153
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:02,593
Never had any adventures
or did anything unexpected.

154
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:09,099
If you're referring to the incident
with the dragon, I was barely involved.

155
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:12,853
All I did was give your uncle
a little nudge out of the door.

156
00:14:13,062 --> 00:14:17,107
Whatever you did, you've been officially
labeled a disturber of the peace.

157
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:19,443
Oh, really?

158
00:14:25,074 --> 00:14:27,034
Gandalf! Gandalf!

159
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:34,375
Fireworks, Gandalf!

160
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:40,047
- Gandalf!
- Fireworks, Gandalf!

161
00:14:58,899 --> 00:14:59,942
Gandalf?

162
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:04,613
- I'm glad you're back.
- So am I, dear boy.

163
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:10,828
So am I.

164
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:31,473
Whoa, whoa.

165
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:44,194
No, thank you!

166
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:48,323
We don't want any more visitors,
well-wishers or distant relations!

167
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:52,035
And what about very old friends?

168
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:56,874
Gandalf?

169
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:01,044
- Bilbo Baggins.
- My dear Gandalf!

170
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:06,383
Good to see you. 111 years old!
Who would believe it?

171
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:10,137
You haven't aged a day.

172
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:18,729
Come on, come in!

173
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:21,356
Welcome, welcome.

174
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:25,068
Oh, here we are.

175
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:29,198
Tea? Or maybe something
a little stronger?

176
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:33,160
I've got a few bottles
of the Old Winyard left. 1296.

177
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:37,414
Very good year. Almost as old as I am.

178
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:43,086
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one, eh?

179
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:45,923
Just tea, thank you.

180
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,095
Oh!

181
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:53,931
I was expecting you sometime
last week.

182
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:57,434
Not that it matters. You come and go as
you please. Always have and always will.

183
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:02,940
You caught me a bit unprepared. We've
only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle...

184
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:06,443
There's some cheese here.
No, that won't do.

185
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:10,614
We've got raspberry jam,
an apple tart...

186
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:15,244
But not much for afters.
Oh, no, we're all right.

187
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:18,288
I've just found some sponge cake.

188
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,543
I could make you some eggs
if you'd--

189
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:28,966
- Just tea, thank you.
- Oh, right.

190
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:32,469
- You don't mind if I eat, do you?
- No, not at all.

191
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:35,430
Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!

192
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:37,224
I'm not at home!

193
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,816
It's the Sackville-Bagginses.

194
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,110
- I know you're in there!
- They're after the house.

195
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:51,280
They've never forgiven me
for living this long.

196
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:54,283
I've got to get away from these confounded
relatives, hanging on the bell all day...

197
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:56,326
...never giving me a moment's peace.

198
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:00,664
I want to see mountains again.
Mountains, Gandalf!

199
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:05,335
And then find somewhere quiet
where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.

200
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:09,506
- So you mean to go through with your plan?
- Yes, yes. It's all in hand.

201
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:11,967
All the arrangements are made.

202
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:15,512
Oh, thank you.

203
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:18,348
Frodo suspects something.

204
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:21,018
Of course he does. He's a Baggins...

205
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:23,854
...not some blockheaded Bracegirdle
from Hardbottle.

206
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:27,190
You will tell him, won't you?

207
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:30,152
- Yes, yes.
- He's very fond of you.

208
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:33,864
I know.

209
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:39,536
He'd probably come with me
if I asked him.

210
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:43,665
I think in his heart, Frodo's
still in love with the Shire.

211
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,544
The woods, the fields.

212
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:50,047
Little rivers.

213
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:57,220
I am old, Gandalf.

214
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:03,894
I know I don't look it, but I'm
beginning to feel it in my heart.

215
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:08,565
I feel thin.

216
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:10,400
Sort of stretched...

217
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:15,072
...like butter scraped
over too much bread.

218
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:19,743
I need a holiday. A very long holiday.

219
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:23,205
And I don't expect I shall return.

220
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:28,585
In fact, I mean not to.

221
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:35,384
Old Toby. The finest weed
in the Southfarthing.

222
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:51,733
Ah.

223
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:55,278
Gandalf, my old friend...

224
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:58,281
...this will be a night to remember.

225
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:22,139
Hello, hello.

226
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:26,476
Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

227
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:30,105
Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.

228
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:36,278
- I think I'll just have another ale.
- Oh, no, you don't.

229
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,114
Go on!

230
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,001
So there I was...

231
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:55,338
...at the mercy
of three monstrous trolls.

232
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:57,507
And they were all arguing
amongst themselves...

233
00:20:57,674 --> 00:21:00,135
...about how they were
going to cook us.

234
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:05,348
Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit
on us one by one, squash us into jelly.

235
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:09,936
They spent so much time arguing
the whithertos and the whyfors...

236
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:13,690
...that the sun's first light
crept over the top of the trees...

237
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:17,194
...and turned them all to stone!

238
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:23,867
Quickly.

239
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:27,829
Whoa!

240
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:30,040
Up they go!

241
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:34,211
No, the big one.

242
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:46,223
Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

243
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:48,350
Are all these children yours?

244
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:51,520
Good gracious,
you have been productive.

245
00:21:53,522 --> 00:21:54,856
Bilbo?

246
00:21:56,566 --> 00:21:58,235
Sackville-Bagginses!

247
00:21:58,485 --> 00:21:59,569
Quickly, hide!

248
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:11,581
Thank you, my boy.

249
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,502
You're a good lad, Frodo.

250
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:19,589
I'm very selfish, you know.

251
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:23,426
Yes, I am. Very selfish.

252
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:25,846
I don't know why I took you in
after your mother and father died...

253
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:27,556
...but it wasn't out of charity.

254
00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:29,724
I think it was because...

255
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:32,227
...of all my numerous relations...

256
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:36,022
...you were the one Baggins
that showed real spirit.

257
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:38,108
Bilbo, have you been
at the Gaffer's home brew?

258
00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:40,026
No.

259
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:42,946
Well, yes, but that's not the point.

260
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:46,408
The point is, Frodo...

261
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:51,454
...you'll be all right.

262
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,960
- Done!
- You're supposed to stick it in the ground.

263
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:58,628
- It is in the ground.
- Outside!

264
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:00,297
This was your idea.

265
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:17,647
Bilbo.

266
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:21,651
Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!

267
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:25,155
Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon
in these parts for a thousand years.

268
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:42,339
- That was good.
- Let's get another one.

269
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:48,094
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.

270
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:50,138
I might've known.

271
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:58,104
Speech, Bilbo!

272
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,315
Speech!

273
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:01,608
Speech!

274
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:09,157
My dear Bagginses and Boffins...

275
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:12,160
...Tooks and Brandybucks...

276
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:14,829
...Grubbs, Chubbs...

277
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:16,081
...Hornblowers...

278
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:18,875
...Bolgers...

279
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:20,835
...Bracegirdles...

280
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:23,672
- ...and Proudfoots.
- Proudfeet!

281
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,010
Today is my 111th birthday!

282
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:32,347
Happy birthday!

283
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:36,851
But alas, eleventy-one years is
far too short a time to live among...

284
00:24:37,018 --> 00:24:39,896
...such excellent
and admirable Hobbits.

285
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:43,566
I don't know half of you
half as well as I should like...

286
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:48,363
...and I like less than half of you
half as well as you deserve.

287
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:53,493
I, uh--

288
00:24:58,331 --> 00:25:00,709
I have things to do.

289
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:09,217
I've put this off far too long.

290
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:17,017
I regret to announce this is the end!

291
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:19,352
I'm going now.

292
00:25:20,437 --> 00:25:23,356
I bid you all a very fond farewell.

293
00:25:25,734 --> 00:25:26,943
Goodbye.

294
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:03,313
I suppose you think
that was terribly clever.

295
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,900
Come on, Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?

296
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:12,113
There are many magic rings in this world,
and none of them should be used lightly.

297
00:26:12,322 --> 00:26:14,491
It was just a bit of fun.

298
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:18,411
Oh, you're probably right, as usual.

299
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:23,333
- You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
- Two eyes.

300
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,211
As often as I can spare them.

301
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:29,589
- I'm leaving everything to him.
- What about this ring of yours?

302
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:33,134
- Is that staying too?
- Yes, yes.

303
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,639
It's in an envelope over there
on the mantelpiece.

304
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:41,684
No. Wait, it's...

305
00:26:44,187 --> 00:26:46,856
...here in my pocket.

306
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:54,739
Isn't that--? Isn't that odd, now?

307
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:59,869
Yet, after all, why not?

308
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:06,334
- Why shouldn't I keep it?
- I think you should leave the ring behind.

309
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:08,962
Is that so hard?

310
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:10,463
Well, no.

311
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:14,384
And yes.

312
00:27:16,344 --> 00:27:19,389
Now it comes to it,
I don't feel like parting with it.

313
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:21,391
It's mine. I found it! It came to me!

314
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:25,812
- There's no need to get angry.
- Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!

315
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:28,064
It's mine.

316
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:31,818
My own.

317
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:36,156
- My precious.
- Precious?

318
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:39,200
It's been called that before,
but not by you.

319
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:41,995
What business is it of yours
what I do with my own things?

320
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:44,914
I think you've had that ring
quite long enough.

321
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:48,001
- You want it for yourself!
- Bilbo Baggins!

322
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:52,422
Do not take me for some conjurer
of cheap tricks.

323
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:56,342
I am not trying to rob you.

324
00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:03,099
I'm trying to help you.

325
00:28:11,566 --> 00:28:14,903
All your long years,
we've been friends.

326
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:17,447
Trust me as you once did.

327
00:28:19,282 --> 00:28:21,117
Let it go.

328
00:28:22,243 --> 00:28:24,662
You're right, Gandalf.

329
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:29,459
The ring must go to Frodo.

330
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:33,796
It's late. The road is long.

331
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:36,466
Yes, it is time.

332
00:28:39,302 --> 00:28:41,304
- Bilbo.
- Hm?

333
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:44,307
The ring is still in your pocket.

334
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:48,603
Ah. Yes.

335
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:22,011
I've thought up an ending for my book:

336
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:28,685
"And he lived happily ever after
to the end of his days."

337
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:32,313
And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

338
00:29:33,356 --> 00:29:34,816
Goodbye, Gandalf.

339
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:40,196
Goodbye, dear Bilbo.

340
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:52,208
<i>The road goes ever on and on</i>

341
00:29:54,752 --> 00:29:57,130
Until our next meeting.

342
00:30:24,532 --> 00:30:28,202
<i>It's mine. My own.</i>

343
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:31,789
<i>My precious.</i>

344
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:35,001
Riddles in the dark.

345
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:36,627
Bilbo!

346
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:38,379
Bilbo!

347
00:30:42,008 --> 00:30:44,927
My precious.

348
00:30:46,554 --> 00:30:48,765
Precious.

349
00:30:48,931 --> 00:30:51,517
He's gone, hasn't he?

350
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:57,315
He talked for so long about leaving...

351
00:30:57,565 --> 00:31:00,276
...I didn't think he'd really do it.

352
00:31:04,739 --> 00:31:06,616
Gandalf?

353
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:16,584
Bilbo's ring.

354
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:19,295
He's gone to stay with the Elves.

355
00:31:19,462 --> 00:31:22,590
He's left you Bag End.

356
00:31:26,177 --> 00:31:28,763
Along with all his possessions.

357
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:31,808
The ring is yours now.

358
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:37,939
- Put it somewhere out of sight.
- Where are you going?

359
00:31:38,106 --> 00:31:40,358
- There are some things that I must see to.
- What things?

360
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:44,821
- Questions. Questions that need answering.
- You've only just arrived.

361
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:48,324
I don't understand.

362
00:31:51,661 --> 00:31:52,662
Neither do I.

363
00:31:55,957 --> 00:31:58,292
Keep it secret.

364
00:31:58,459 --> 00:32:00,211
Keep it safe.

365
00:32:35,204 --> 00:32:37,373
<i>Shire!</i>

366
00:32:37,707 --> 00:32:40,835
<i>Baggins!</i>

367
00:33:29,383 --> 00:33:32,261
<i>"The year 3434 of the Second Age.</i>

368
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:36,891
<i>Here follows the account of Isildur,
High King of Gondor...</i>

369
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:40,770
<i>...and the finding
of the Ring of Power."</i>

370
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:46,108
<i>"It has come to me.</i>

371
00:33:46,275 --> 00:33:49,779
<i>The One Ring. It shall be
an heirloom of my kingdom.</i>

372
00:33:49,946 --> 00:33:53,407
<i>All those who follow in my bloodline
shall be bound to its fate...</i>

373
00:33:53,616 --> 00:33:57,411
<i>...for I will risk
no hurt to the Ring.</i>

374
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,122
<i>It is precious to me...</i>

375
00:34:00,957 --> 00:34:03,626
<i>...though I buy it with great pain.</i>

376
00:34:06,754 --> 00:34:10,967
<i>The markings upon the band
begin to fade.</i>

377
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:15,972
<i>The writing, which at first was as clear
as red flame, has all but disappeared.</i>

378
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:20,268
<i>A secret now
that only fire can tell."</i>

379
00:34:36,784 --> 00:34:39,787
Shire.

380
00:34:39,954 --> 00:34:41,956
Baggins.

381
00:34:42,456 --> 00:34:46,502
There's no Bagginses around here.
They're all up in Hobbiton.

382
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,672
That way.

383
00:34:55,678 --> 00:34:57,888
<i>To heal my heart and drown my woe</i>

384
00:34:58,055 --> 00:35:00,391
<i>Rain may fall and wind may blow</i>

385
00:35:00,558 --> 00:35:02,518
<i>But there still be</i>

386
00:35:02,685 --> 00:35:04,145
<i>Many miles to go</i>

387
00:35:04,353 --> 00:35:06,272
<i>Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain</i>

388
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,649
<i>And the stream that falls
From hill to plain</i>

389
00:35:08,858 --> 00:35:10,693
<i>Better than rain or rippling brook</i>

390
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,279
<i>Is a mug of beer inside this Took</i>

391
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:19,535
There's been some strange folk
crossing the Shire.

392
00:35:19,994 --> 00:35:23,831
Dwarves and others of a less
than savory nature.

393
00:35:24,332 --> 00:35:25,708
War is brewing.

394
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:29,211
The mountains are fair teeming
with goblins.

395
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:32,048
Far-off tales and children's stories,
that's all that is.

396
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:36,719
You're beginning to sound like that old
Bilbo Baggins. Cracked, he was.

397
00:35:36,886 --> 00:35:39,889
Young Mr. Frodo here,
he's cracking.

398
00:35:40,056 --> 00:35:41,515
And proud of it.

399
00:35:41,682 --> 00:35:43,934
- Cheers, Gaffer.
- Cheers.

400
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:48,230
It's none of our concern what goes on
beyond our borders.

401
00:35:48,397 --> 00:35:52,735
Keep your nose out of trouble,
and no trouble'll come to you.

402
00:35:56,072 --> 00:35:58,282
- Good night, lads.
- Good night.

403
00:35:58,449 --> 00:36:02,953
Good night, sweet maiden
of the golden ale.

404
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,539
Mind who you're sweet-talking.

405
00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:10,252
Don't worry, Sam. Rosie knows an idiot
when she sees one.

406
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:12,421
Does she?

407
00:36:13,089 --> 00:36:16,092
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night, Mr. Frodo.

408
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:43,369
Is it secret? Is it safe?

409
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:50,584
Ah.

410
00:36:52,253 --> 00:36:54,380
What are you doing?

411
00:37:06,976 --> 00:37:09,478
Hold out your hand, Frodo.

412
00:37:09,645 --> 00:37:10,813
It's quite cool.

413
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,152
What can you see?

414
00:37:17,987 --> 00:37:20,322
Can you see anything?

415
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:24,493
Nothing.

416
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,121
There's nothing.

417
00:37:28,164 --> 00:37:29,665
Wait.

418
00:37:33,794 --> 00:37:36,005
There are markings.

419
00:37:37,506 --> 00:37:40,926
It's some form of Elvish.
I can't read it.

420
00:37:41,135 --> 00:37:43,679
There are few who can.

421
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:49,059
The language is that of Mordor,
which I will not utter here.

422
00:37:49,685 --> 00:37:50,728
Mordor!

423
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,022
In the common tongue, it says:

424
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:56,734
"One Ring to rule them all...

425
00:37:57,026 --> 00:37:59,320
...One Ring to find them...

426
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:01,697
...One Ring to bring them all...

427
00:38:02,031 --> 00:38:05,034
...and in the darkness bind them."

428
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,704
This is the One Ring...

429
00:38:08,871 --> 00:38:14,168
...forged by the Dark Lord Sauron
in the fires of Mount Doom.

430
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:18,380
Taken by Isildur
from the hand of Sauron himself.

431
00:38:19,173 --> 00:38:21,717
Bilbo found it.

432
00:38:22,176 --> 00:38:24,094
- In Gollum's cave.
- Yes.

433
00:38:24,345 --> 00:38:28,891
For 60 years, the Ring lay quiet
in Bilbo's keeping...

434
00:38:29,058 --> 00:38:32,478
...prolonging his life,
delaying old age.

435
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:37,566
But no longer, Frodo.
Evil is stirring in Mordor.

436
00:38:37,733 --> 00:38:40,110
The Ring has awoken.

437
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:43,072
It's heard its master's call.

438
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,201
But he was destroyed.
Sauron was destroyed.

439
00:38:52,915 --> 00:38:55,000
No, Frodo.

440
00:38:55,918 --> 00:38:59,255
The spirit of Sauron endured.

441
00:38:59,421 --> 00:39:04,760
His life force is bound to the Ring,
and the Ring survived.

442
00:39:05,094 --> 00:39:07,263
Sauron has returned.

443
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:10,266
His Orcs have multiplied.

444
00:39:10,432 --> 00:39:14,478
His fortress at Barad-dûr
is rebuilt in the land of Mordor.

445
00:39:14,645 --> 00:39:19,441
Sauron needs only this Ring to cover
all the lands in a second darkness.

446
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,735
He is seeking it.

447
00:39:21,944 --> 00:39:25,781
Seeking it. All his thought
is bent on it.

448
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:28,742
For the Ring yearns above all else...

449
00:39:28,951 --> 00:39:32,329
...to return to the hand
of its master.

450
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:34,331
They are one...

451
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:37,626
...the Ring and the Dark Lord.

452
00:39:37,793 --> 00:39:38,836
Frodo...

453
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,297
...he must never find it.

454
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:42,548
All right.

455
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:47,177
We put it away. We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.

456
00:39:47,344 --> 00:39:50,055
No one knows it's here, do they?

457
00:39:55,686 --> 00:39:56,937
Do they, Gandalf?

458
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:01,358
There is one other who knew
that Bilbo had the Ring.

459
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:05,654
I looked everywhere
for the creature Gollum.

460
00:40:05,821 --> 00:40:07,990
But the enemy found him first.

461
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:12,202
<i>I don't know how long
they tortured him.</i>

462
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:16,874
<i>But amidst the endless screams and
inane babble, they discerned two words:</i>

463
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:19,209
Shire!

464
00:40:19,376 --> 00:40:21,003
Baggins!

465
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:23,047
Shire.

466
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:26,175
Baggins. But that would
lead them here!

467
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:30,012
Who goes there?

468
00:40:31,722 --> 00:40:32,973
Take it, Gandalf!

469
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:34,391
- Take it!
- No, Frodo.

470
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,977
- You must take it!
- You cannot offer me this ring!

471
00:40:37,186 --> 00:40:40,522
- I'm giving it to you!
- Don't tempt me, Frodo!

472
00:40:42,024 --> 00:40:44,234
I dare not take it.

473
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:47,029
Not even to keep it safe.

474
00:40:48,197 --> 00:40:50,199
Understand, Frodo...

475
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:54,495
...I would use this Ring
from a desire to do good.

476
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:05,631
But through me, it would wield a power
too great and terrible to imagine.

477
00:41:06,215 --> 00:41:09,134
- But it cannot stay in the Shire!
- No.

478
00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:12,638
No, it can't.

479
00:41:17,935 --> 00:41:19,353
What must I do?

480
00:41:21,021 --> 00:41:24,566
- You must leave. And leave quickly.
- Where? Where do I go?

481
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:28,028
Get out of the Shire.
Make for the village of Bree.

482
00:41:28,278 --> 00:41:29,405
Bree.

483
00:41:29,571 --> 00:41:32,366
- What about you?
- I'll be waiting for you...

484
00:41:32,574 --> 00:41:35,035
...at the inn of the Prancing Pony.

485
00:41:35,244 --> 00:41:38,956
- And the Ring will be safe there?
- I don't know, Frodo.

486
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:41,166
I don't have any answers.

487
00:41:42,668 --> 00:41:48,257
I must see the head of my order. He is
both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo.

488
00:41:48,424 --> 00:41:50,551
He'll know what to do.

489
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:53,971
You'll have to leave the name
of Baggins behind you.

490
00:41:54,263 --> 00:41:56,765
That name is not safe
outside the Shire.

491
00:41:57,391 --> 00:42:00,686
Travel only by day.
And stay off the road.

492
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:04,481
I can cut across country
easily enough.

493
00:42:06,984 --> 00:42:08,318
My dear Frodo.

494
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:11,655
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.

495
00:42:11,822 --> 00:42:14,783
You can learn all that there is to
know about their ways in a month.

496
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:17,327
And yet, after a hundred years...

497
00:42:17,494 --> 00:42:19,580
...they can still surprise you.

498
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:22,499
Get down.

499
00:42:34,803 --> 00:42:38,265
Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee!
Have you been eavesdropping?

500
00:42:38,432 --> 00:42:42,936
I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.
I was cutting the grass under the window.

501
00:42:43,103 --> 00:42:45,522
A little late for trimming the verge,
don't you think?

502
00:42:45,731 --> 00:42:48,609
- I heard raised voices.
- What did you hear? Speak!

503
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:49,860
Nothing important.

504
00:42:50,444 --> 00:42:54,531
That is, I heard a good deal about a ring,
a Dark Lord and the end of the world but--

505
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:59,495
Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me.
Don't turn me into anything unnatural.

506
00:43:00,162 --> 00:43:01,830
No?

507
00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:04,166
Perhaps not.

508
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:08,837
I've thought of a better use for you.

509
00:43:10,547 --> 00:43:13,550
Come along, Samwise. Keep up.

510
00:43:15,052 --> 00:43:17,346
Be careful, both of you.

511
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:20,349
The enemy has many spies
in his service:

512
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:23,519
Birds, beasts.

513
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:27,064
Is it safe?

514
00:43:28,774 --> 00:43:30,150
Never put it on...

515
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:33,737
...for the agents of the Dark Lord
will be drawn to its power.

516
00:43:33,904 --> 00:43:35,405
Always remember, Frodo...

517
00:43:35,906 --> 00:43:39,076
...the Ring is trying to get back
to its master.

518
00:43:39,493 --> 00:43:41,578
It wants to be found.

519
00:44:22,202 --> 00:44:24,413
This is it.

520
00:44:24,746 --> 00:44:26,915
This is what?

521
00:44:27,207 --> 00:44:29,251
If I take one more step...

522
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:33,630
...it'll be the farthest away
from home I've ever been.

523
00:44:37,926 --> 00:44:39,428
Come on, Sam.

524
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:49,646
Remember what Bilbo used to say:

525
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:53,984
- "It's a dangerous business, Frodo."
<i>- "Going out your door.</i>

526
00:44:54,151 --> 00:44:58,614
<i>You step onto the road,
and if you don't keep your feet...</i>

527
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:02,951
<i>...there's no knowing where
you might be swept off to."</i>

528
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:18,800
Sam.

529
00:45:22,304 --> 00:45:23,430
Wood-elves.

530
00:45:37,152 --> 00:45:40,656
They're going to the harbor
beyond the White Towers.

531
00:45:41,198 --> 00:45:42,991
To the Grey Havens.

532
00:45:43,575 --> 00:45:45,619
They're leaving Middle-earth.

533
00:45:45,786 --> 00:45:47,996
Never to return.

534
00:45:50,874 --> 00:45:53,001
I don't know why...

535
00:45:53,669 --> 00:45:56,088
...it makes me sad.

536
00:45:58,173 --> 00:46:02,803
Everywhere I lie there's a dirty
great root sticking into my back.

537
00:46:03,512 --> 00:46:05,222
Just shut your eyes...

538
00:46:05,389 --> 00:46:08,183
...and imagine you're back
in your own bed...

539
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:12,312
...with a soft mattress
and a lovely feather pillow.

540
00:46:21,613 --> 00:46:24,324
It's not working, Mr. Frodo.

541
00:46:24,491 --> 00:46:27,369
I'm never going to be able
to sleep out here.

542
00:46:29,705 --> 00:46:32,040
Me neither, Sam.

543
00:47:00,569 --> 00:47:03,613
<i>Smoke rises
from the Mountain of Doom.</i>

544
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,449
<i>The hour grows late.</i>

545
00:47:05,657 --> 00:47:09,244
<i>And Gandalf the Grey
rides to Isengard...</i>

546
00:47:09,411 --> 00:47:11,872
<i>...seeking my counsel.</i>

547
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:16,084
For that is why you have come,
is it not?

548
00:47:16,251 --> 00:47:17,544
My old friend.

549
00:47:17,794 --> 00:47:19,421
Saruman.

550
00:47:24,217 --> 00:47:27,262
- You are sure of this?
- Beyond any doubt.

551
00:47:28,055 --> 00:47:30,307
So the Ring of Power has been found.

552
00:47:30,474 --> 00:47:33,727
All these long years,
it was in the Shire.

553
00:47:33,894 --> 00:47:37,064
- Under my very nose.
- Yet you did not have the wit to see it.

554
00:47:37,689 --> 00:47:42,194
Your love of the halfling's leaf
has clearly slowed your mind.

555
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:47,074
But we still have time. Time enough
to counter Sauron if we act quickly.

556
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:48,700
Time?

557
00:47:49,618 --> 00:47:52,245
What time do you think we have?

558
00:47:52,704 --> 00:47:56,583
Sauron has regained
much of his former strength.

559
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,960
He cannot yet take physical form...

560
00:47:59,211 --> 00:48:01,922
...but his spirit has lost
none of its potency.

561
00:48:02,589 --> 00:48:07,636
Concealed within his fortress,
the Lord of Mordor sees all.

562
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:14,142
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow,
earth and flesh.

563
00:48:15,644 --> 00:48:18,814
You know of what I speak, Gandalf.

564
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:24,986
A Great Eye, lidless,
wreathed in flame.

565
00:48:25,946 --> 00:48:27,739
The Eye of Sauron.

566
00:48:27,948 --> 00:48:30,534
He is gathering all evil to him.

567
00:48:30,742 --> 00:48:33,245
Very soon, he'll have summoned
an army great enough...

568
00:48:33,412 --> 00:48:35,622
...for an assault upon Middle-earth.

569
00:48:35,956 --> 00:48:38,333
You know this?

570
00:48:38,834 --> 00:48:40,335
How?

571
00:48:40,961 --> 00:48:42,629
I have seen it.

572
00:48:43,046 --> 00:48:46,258
A palantír is a dangerous tool,
Saruman.

573
00:48:46,967 --> 00:48:48,468
Why?

574
00:48:48,927 --> 00:48:51,638
Why should we fear to use it?

575
00:48:54,266 --> 00:48:58,186
They are not all accounted for,
the lost Seeing-stones.

576
00:48:58,353 --> 00:49:01,606
We do not know who else
may be watching.

577
00:49:04,192 --> 00:49:06,945
The hour is later than you think.

578
00:49:07,112 --> 00:49:09,448
Sauron's forces are already moving.

579
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:14,453
The Nine have left Minas Morgul.

580
00:49:14,828 --> 00:49:15,871
The Nine?

581
00:49:16,037 --> 00:49:19,124
They crossed the River Isen
on Midsummer's Eve...

582
00:49:19,291 --> 00:49:21,960
...disguised as riders in black.

583
00:49:22,169 --> 00:49:26,131
- They've reached the Shire?
- They will find the Ring.

584
00:49:27,716 --> 00:49:29,968
And kill the one who carries it.

585
00:49:30,469 --> 00:49:31,970
Frodo!

586
00:49:44,566 --> 00:49:48,987
You did not seriously think that a Hobbit
could contend with the will of Sauron?

587
00:49:49,738 --> 00:49:52,532
There are none who can.

588
00:49:55,035 --> 00:49:57,746
Against the power of Mordor...

589
00:49:57,913 --> 00:50:00,582
...there can be no victory.

590
00:50:02,542 --> 00:50:05,712
We must join with him, Gandalf.

591
00:50:07,005 --> 00:50:09,341
We must join with Sauron.

592
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:14,679
It would be wise, my friend.

593
00:50:15,138 --> 00:50:16,598
Tell me...

594
00:50:16,765 --> 00:50:17,849
...friend...

595
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:23,396
...when did Saruman the Wise
abandon reason for madness?

596
00:51:02,894 --> 00:51:04,604
I gave you the chance...

597
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:08,400
...of aiding me willingly...

598
00:51:08,567 --> 00:51:12,737
...but you have elected
the way of pain!

599
00:51:36,011 --> 00:51:37,512
Mr. Frodo?

600
00:51:38,138 --> 00:51:39,931
Frodo? Frodo!

601
00:51:41,349 --> 00:51:44,603
- I thought I'd lost you.
- What are you talking about?

602
00:51:44,769 --> 00:51:47,772
- It's just something Gandalf said.
- What did he say?

603
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:52,485
"Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee."
And I don't mean to.

604
00:51:52,736 --> 00:51:56,364
Sam, we're still in the Shire.
What could possibly happen?

605
00:51:59,326 --> 00:52:00,368
Frodo.

606
00:52:00,619 --> 00:52:02,871
- Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.
- Hello, Frodo.

607
00:52:03,038 --> 00:52:04,456
Get off him.

608
00:52:04,956 --> 00:52:06,458
Come on, Frodo.

609
00:52:06,625 --> 00:52:08,501
What's the meaning of this?

610
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,712
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

611
00:52:13,214 --> 00:52:15,342
You get back here!

612
00:52:16,343 --> 00:52:17,677
Get out of my field!

613
00:52:17,844 --> 00:52:20,680
You'll know the devil
if I catch up with you!

614
00:52:20,889 --> 00:52:23,850
I don't know why he's so upset.
It's only a couple of carrots.

615
00:52:24,017 --> 00:52:25,143
And some cabbages.

616
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:28,229
And those three bags of potatoes
that we lifted last week.

617
00:52:28,396 --> 00:52:32,484
- And then the mushrooms the week before.
- Yes, Pippin. My point is...

618
00:52:32,692 --> 00:52:34,861
...he's clearly overreacting.

619
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:36,571
Run!

620
00:52:50,043 --> 00:52:52,587
Oh, that was close.

621
00:52:53,672 --> 00:52:56,800
I think I've broken something.

622
00:52:57,801 --> 00:53:00,178
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!

623
00:53:00,345 --> 00:53:04,015
What? That was just a detour.
A short cut.

624
00:53:04,182 --> 00:53:06,434
- Short cut to what?
- Mushrooms!

625
00:53:15,193 --> 00:53:16,695
That's mine.

626
00:53:19,447 --> 00:53:21,074
That's nice, Merry.

627
00:53:21,616 --> 00:53:23,618
Here's a nice one, Sam.

628
00:53:23,827 --> 00:53:26,371
I think we should get off the road.

629
00:53:35,547 --> 00:53:36,923
Get off the road!

630
00:53:37,132 --> 00:53:38,633
Quick!

631
00:53:51,312 --> 00:53:52,814
Be quiet!

632
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:01,299
What was that?

633
00:55:33,998 --> 00:55:35,500
Anything?

634
00:55:36,167 --> 00:55:37,669
Nothing.

635
00:55:38,378 --> 00:55:40,672
What is going on?

636
00:55:41,214 --> 00:55:45,009
That Black Rider was looking
for something. Or someone.

637
00:55:46,344 --> 00:55:47,846
Frodo?

638
00:55:48,555 --> 00:55:49,597
Get down!

639
00:56:06,531 --> 00:56:08,783
I have to leave the Shire.

640
00:56:09,784 --> 00:56:12,078
Sam and I must get to Bree.

641
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:13,705
Right.

642
00:56:15,081 --> 00:56:17,375
Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me.

643
00:56:25,633 --> 00:56:27,010
Run!

644
00:56:28,219 --> 00:56:30,221
This way! Follow me!

645
00:56:33,766 --> 00:56:34,809
Run!

646
00:56:48,072 --> 00:56:49,824
Get the rope, Sam!

647
00:56:52,493 --> 00:56:54,037
Frodo!

648
00:56:54,746 --> 00:56:56,164
Run, Frodo!

649
00:56:56,497 --> 00:56:57,582
- Go!
- Hurry!

650
00:56:57,790 --> 00:57:00,418
Frodo, come on!

651
00:57:01,336 --> 00:57:03,338
- Come on! Faster!
- Jump!

652
00:57:18,311 --> 00:57:22,523
- How far to the nearest crossing?
- The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miles.

653
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:38,623
Come on.

654
00:57:49,801 --> 00:57:53,221
- What do you want?
- We're heading for the Prancing Pony.

655
00:57:56,724 --> 00:57:59,560
Hobbits. Four Hobbits!

656
00:57:59,727 --> 00:58:03,690
What's more, out of the Shire by your
talk. What business brings you to Bree?

657
00:58:04,107 --> 00:58:07,235
We wish to stay at the inn.
Our business is our own.

658
00:58:08,236 --> 00:58:10,822
All right, young sir.
I meant no offense.

659
00:58:10,989 --> 00:58:13,533
It's my job to ask questions
after nightfall.

660
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:16,536
There's talk of strange folk abroad.

661
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:18,871
Can't be too careful.

662
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:42,103
Out of the way!
Watch where you're walking.

663
00:59:06,252 --> 00:59:07,879
Excuse me.

664
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,716
Good evening, little masters.
What can I do for you?

665
00:59:11,883 --> 00:59:17,972
If you're seeking accommodation, we got
some cozy Hobbit-sized rooms available.

666
00:59:18,181 --> 00:59:22,810
Always proud to cater
to the Little Folk, Mister...?

667
00:59:23,978 --> 00:59:26,022
Underhill. My name's Underhill.

668
00:59:27,315 --> 00:59:29,817
- Underhill, yes.
- We're friends of Gandalf the Grey.

669
00:59:29,984 --> 00:59:33,154
- Can you tell him we've arrived?
- Gandalf?

670
00:59:33,571 --> 00:59:35,323
Gandalf.

671
00:59:36,157 --> 00:59:37,825
Oh, yes...

672
00:59:38,034 --> 00:59:40,161
...I remember. Elderly chap.

673
00:59:40,495 --> 00:59:43,414
Big Grey beard, pointy hat.

674
00:59:43,831 --> 00:59:45,666
Not seen him for six months.

675
00:59:52,423 --> 00:59:53,716
What do we do now?

676
01:00:00,932 --> 01:00:02,183
Sam...

677
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:04,227
...he'll be here. He'll come.

678
01:00:07,021 --> 01:00:09,065
Get out of my way!

679
01:00:11,442 --> 01:00:13,111
What's that?

680
01:00:13,361 --> 01:00:15,863
This, my friend, is a pint.

681
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:17,698
It comes in pints?

682
01:00:18,032 --> 01:00:21,744
- I'm getting one.
- You got a whole half already!

683
01:00:28,084 --> 01:00:31,921
That fellow's done nothing
but stare at you since we arrived.

684
01:00:35,466 --> 01:00:36,968
Excuse me.

685
01:00:38,761 --> 01:00:41,764
That Man in the corner. Who is he?

686
01:00:42,932 --> 01:00:47,353
He's one of them Rangers. They're
dangerous folk, wandering the Wilds.

687
01:00:47,603 --> 01:00:52,108
What his right name is, I've never heard,
but around here he's known as Strider.

688
01:00:54,485 --> 01:00:55,736
Strider.

689
01:01:08,749 --> 01:01:11,961
<i>Baggins.</i>

690
01:01:14,797 --> 01:01:16,966
<i>Baggins.</i>

691
01:01:22,346 --> 01:01:27,476
<i>Baggins. Baggins.</i>

692
01:01:29,312 --> 01:01:31,606
Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins.

693
01:01:32,398 --> 01:01:35,276
He's over there. Frodo Baggins.

694
01:01:35,443 --> 01:01:38,487
He's my second cousin,
once removed on his mother's side...

695
01:01:38,654 --> 01:01:40,948
...and my third cousin, twice removed...

696
01:01:45,453 --> 01:01:47,205
- Pippin!
- Steady on, Frodo.

697
01:02:16,734 --> 01:02:19,195
You cannot hide.

698
01:02:22,156 --> 01:02:25,326
I see you.

699
01:02:26,994 --> 01:02:29,705
There is no life...

700
01:02:29,872 --> 01:02:32,083
...in the void.

701
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:33,751
Only...

702
01:02:34,669 --> 01:02:36,170
...death.

703
01:02:42,176 --> 01:02:47,056
You draw far too much attention
to yourself, "Mr. Underhill."

704
01:02:51,727 --> 01:02:52,770
What do you want?

705
01:02:52,979 --> 01:02:55,022
A little more caution from you.
That is no trinket you carry.

706
01:02:55,398 --> 01:02:58,401
- I carry nothing.
- Indeed.

707
01:02:58,693 --> 01:03:01,237
I can avoid being seen if I wish...

708
01:03:01,404 --> 01:03:05,116
...but to disappear entirely,
that is a rare gift.

709
01:03:05,616 --> 01:03:08,244
- Who are you?
- Are you frightened?

710
01:03:09,495 --> 01:03:10,538
Yes.

711
01:03:10,705 --> 01:03:14,625
Not nearly frightened enough.
I know what hunts you.

712
01:03:18,629 --> 01:03:21,173
Let him go!
Or I'll have you, Longshanks.

713
01:03:22,842 --> 01:03:26,971
You have a stout heart, little Hobbit.
But that will not save you.

714
01:03:27,138 --> 01:03:30,057
You can no longer wait
for the wizard, Frodo.

715
01:03:30,224 --> 01:03:31,225
They're coming.

716
01:04:54,934 --> 01:04:56,435
What are they?

717
01:04:58,604 --> 01:05:00,731
They were once Men.

718
01:05:01,232 --> 01:05:03,442
Great kings of Men.

719
01:05:03,651 --> 01:05:06,821
Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them
nine rings of power.

720
01:05:07,405 --> 01:05:10,491
Blinded by their greed,
they took them without question.

721
01:05:10,741 --> 01:05:14,078
One by one, falling into darkness.

722
01:05:14,245 --> 01:05:16,747
Now they are slaves to his will.

723
01:05:19,125 --> 01:05:20,835
They are the Nazgûl.

724
01:05:21,001 --> 01:05:23,754
Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.

725
01:05:24,505 --> 01:05:25,965
At all times they feel...

726
01:05:26,132 --> 01:05:28,092
<i>...the presence of the Ring...</i>

727
01:05:28,259 --> 01:05:32,805
<i>...drawn to the power of the One.
They will never stop hunting you.</i>

728
01:05:42,773 --> 01:05:45,693
- Where are you taking us?
- Into the Wild.

729
01:05:53,868 --> 01:05:57,997
How do we know this Strider
is a friend of Gandalf?

730
01:05:58,164 --> 01:06:01,000
I think a servant of the enemy
would look fairer...

731
01:06:01,375 --> 01:06:05,296
- ...and feel fouler.
- He's foul enough.

732
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:08,716
We have no choice but to trust him.

733
01:06:08,883 --> 01:06:12,344
- But where is he leading us?
- To Rivendell, Master Gamgee.

734
01:06:14,722 --> 01:06:18,017
- To the house of Elrond.
- Did you hear that? Rivendell.

735
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:21,353
We're going to see the Elves.

736
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,254
- Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall.
- What about breakfast?

737
01:06:47,421 --> 01:06:50,090
- You've already had it.
- We've had one, yes.

738
01:06:50,257 --> 01:06:52,510
What about second breakfast?

739
01:06:55,930 --> 01:06:59,099
Don't think he knows
about second breakfast, Pip.

740
01:06:59,266 --> 01:07:04,522
What about elevenses? Luncheon?
Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?

741
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:08,901
- He knows about them, doesn't he?
- I wouldn't count on it.

742
01:07:14,365 --> 01:07:15,950
Pippin!

743
01:07:32,466 --> 01:07:35,970
What do they eat
when they can't get Hobbit?

744
01:08:14,633 --> 01:08:16,844
Who is she?

745
01:08:17,511 --> 01:08:20,139
This woman you sing of.

746
01:08:23,517 --> 01:08:25,978
'Tis the lady of Lúthien.

747
01:08:26,145 --> 01:08:31,317
The Elf-maiden who gave her love
to Beren, a mortal.

748
01:08:33,152 --> 01:08:35,279
What happened to her?

749
01:08:37,489 --> 01:08:39,992
She died.

750
01:08:44,038 --> 01:08:46,373
Get some sleep, Frodo.

751
01:08:56,634 --> 01:09:00,721
<i>The power of Isengard
is at your command...</i>

752
01:09:00,888 --> 01:09:05,351
<i>...Sauron, Lord of the Earth.</i>

753
01:09:08,687 --> 01:09:14,485
<i>Build me an army worthy of Mordor.</i>

754
01:09:20,199 --> 01:09:24,662
What orders from Mordor, my lord?
What does the Eye command?

755
01:09:25,079 --> 01:09:27,039
We have work to do.

756
01:10:09,623 --> 01:10:14,253
The trees are strong, my lord.
Their roots go deep.

757
01:10:14,628 --> 01:10:16,463
Rip them all down.

758
01:10:43,907 --> 01:10:46,785
This was the great watchtower
of Amon Sûl.

759
01:10:48,495 --> 01:10:51,165
We shall rest here tonight.

760
01:11:02,885 --> 01:11:06,305
These are for you.
Keep them close.

761
01:11:06,513 --> 01:11:09,016
I'm going to have a look around.

762
01:11:11,393 --> 01:11:13,312
Stay here.

763
01:11:15,856 --> 01:11:18,025
My tomato's burst.

764
01:11:18,275 --> 01:11:20,152
Could I have some bacon?

765
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:22,321
Want a tomato, Sam?

766
01:11:22,696 --> 01:11:26,366
- What are you doing?!
- Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon.

767
01:11:26,533 --> 01:11:29,286
- We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.
- Put it out, you fools!

768
01:11:29,495 --> 01:11:33,499
- Put it out!
- That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!

769
01:11:41,924 --> 01:11:43,675
Go!

770
01:12:37,104 --> 01:12:38,564
Back, you devils!

771
01:14:02,064 --> 01:14:03,315
Frodo!

772
01:14:07,361 --> 01:14:09,196
- Frodo.
- Oh, Sam.

773
01:14:46,233 --> 01:14:47,234
Strider!

774
01:14:50,028 --> 01:14:55,534
- Help him, Strider.
- He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.

775
01:14:57,035 --> 01:15:01,915
This is beyond my skill to heal.
He needs Elvish medicine.

776
01:15:06,503 --> 01:15:07,546
Hurry!

777
01:15:07,754 --> 01:15:11,717
We're six days from Rivendell!
He'll never make it!

778
01:15:11,925 --> 01:15:13,760
Hold on, Frodo.

779
01:15:15,345 --> 01:15:16,388
Gandalf!

780
01:17:54,296 --> 01:17:57,382
Look, Frodo. It's Mr. Bilbo's trolls.

781
01:17:59,551 --> 01:18:02,387
Mr. Frodo? He's going cold.

782
01:18:05,348 --> 01:18:07,100
Is he going to die?

783
01:18:07,309 --> 01:18:12,189
He's passing into the Shadow World.
He'll soon become a Wraith like them.

784
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:21,198
- They're close.
- Sam, do you know the Athelas plant?

785
01:18:21,364 --> 01:18:22,866
- Athelas?
- Kingsfoil.

786
01:18:23,033 --> 01:18:24,117
Kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed.

787
01:18:24,326 --> 01:18:27,454
It may help to slow the poisoning.
Hurry!

788
01:18:41,843 --> 01:18:45,972
What's this?
A Ranger caught off his guard?

789
01:19:10,872 --> 01:19:11,915
Frodo.

790
01:19:13,875 --> 01:19:17,003
I am Arwen - I've come to help you.

791
01:19:19,422 --> 01:19:21,258
Hear my voice...

792
01:19:21,508 --> 01:19:23,635
Come back to the light.

793
01:19:28,848 --> 01:19:30,684
Who is she?

794
01:19:31,351 --> 01:19:33,103
Frodo.

795
01:19:33,353 --> 01:19:36,856
- She's an Elf.
- He's fading.

796
01:19:39,109 --> 01:19:41,278
He's not going to last.

797
01:19:41,486 --> 01:19:44,155
We must get him to my father.

798
01:19:44,906 --> 01:19:47,784
- I've been looking for you for two days.
- Where are you taking him?

799
01:19:47,951 --> 01:19:54,040
There are five Wraiths behind you.
Where the other four are, I do not know.

800
01:19:55,125 --> 01:19:57,544
Stay with the Hobbits -
I'll send horses for you.

801
01:19:57,711 --> 01:19:59,462
I'm the faster rider - I'll take him.

802
01:20:00,297 --> 01:20:01,673
The Road is too dangerous.

803
01:20:01,881 --> 01:20:03,133
What are they saying?

804
01:20:03,341 --> 01:20:05,385
If I can get across the river...

805
01:20:05,593 --> 01:20:08,179
...the power of my people
will protect him.

806
01:20:09,222 --> 01:20:10,890
I do not fear them.

807
01:20:20,734 --> 01:20:22,152
Arwen...

808
01:20:22,319 --> 01:20:25,530
...ride hard. Don't look back.

809
01:20:30,577 --> 01:20:34,956
What are you doing?!
Those Wraiths are still out there!

810
01:22:29,571 --> 01:22:32,282
Give up the halfling, She-Elf.

811
01:22:33,199 --> 01:22:35,785
If you want him, come and claim him.

812
01:23:29,672 --> 01:23:32,175
No. No!

813
01:23:35,428 --> 01:23:37,722
Frodo, no.

814
01:23:37,931 --> 01:23:40,225
Frodo, don't give in.

815
01:23:40,433 --> 01:23:42,435
Not now.

816
01:23:53,363 --> 01:23:55,865
<i>What grace is given me...</i>

817
01:23:56,533 --> 01:23:58,368
<i>...let it pass to him.</i>

818
01:23:58,618 --> 01:24:00,745
<i>Let him be spared.</i>

819
01:24:01,371 --> 01:24:03,414
<i>Save him.</i>

820
01:24:15,802 --> 01:24:20,974
- Where am I?
- You are in the house of Elrond.

821
01:24:21,432 --> 01:24:27,939
And it is 10:00 in the morning
on October 24th, if you want to know.

822
01:24:29,899 --> 01:24:33,695
- Gandalf!
- Yes, I'm here.

823
01:24:35,321 --> 01:24:38,408
And you're lucky to be here too.

824
01:24:39,075 --> 01:24:43,079
A few more hours and you
would have been beyond our aid.

825
01:24:43,288 --> 01:24:47,417
But you have some strength in you,
my dear Hobbit.

826
01:24:55,008 --> 01:24:57,510
What happened, Gandalf?

827
01:24:58,469 --> 01:25:03,850
- Why didn't you meet us?
- I am sorry, Frodo.

828
01:25:08,605 --> 01:25:10,356
I was delayed.

829
01:25:11,232 --> 01:25:15,445
A friendship with Saruman
is not lightly thrown aside.

830
01:25:19,532 --> 01:25:24,203
One ill turn deserves another.
It is over.

831
01:25:24,495 --> 01:25:27,248
Embrace the power of the Ring...

832
01:25:27,790 --> 01:25:30,335
...or embrace your own destruction!

833
01:25:32,629 --> 01:25:36,507
There is only one Lord of the Ring.

834
01:25:36,758 --> 01:25:40,762
Only one who can bend it to his will.

835
01:25:41,554 --> 01:25:45,516
And he does not share power.

836
01:25:59,864 --> 01:26:03,242
So you have chosen death.

837
01:26:13,294 --> 01:26:17,090
Gandalf? What is it?

838
01:26:18,049 --> 01:26:19,842
Nothing, Frodo.

839
01:26:20,510 --> 01:26:22,345
Frodo!

840
01:26:22,553 --> 01:26:23,596
Frodo!

841
01:26:23,805 --> 01:26:26,182
- Sam.
- Bless you, you're awake!

842
01:26:26,391 --> 01:26:29,102
Sam has hardly left your side.

843
01:26:29,352 --> 01:26:31,521
We were that worried about you.
Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?

844
01:26:31,896 --> 01:26:37,026
By the skills of Lord Elrond,
you're beginning to mend.

845
01:26:38,528 --> 01:26:42,115
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.

846
01:27:30,163 --> 01:27:33,499
- Bilbo!
- Hello, Frodo, my lad.

847
01:27:33,666 --> 01:27:35,376
Bilbo.

848
01:27:40,381 --> 01:27:42,133
<i>"There and Back Again:</i>

849
01:27:42,383 --> 01:27:45,136
<i>A Hobbit's Tale</i>, by Bilbo Baggins."

850
01:27:48,181 --> 01:27:51,768
- This is wonderful.
- I meant to go back...

851
01:27:52,101 --> 01:27:55,897
...wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...

852
01:27:56,355 --> 01:27:58,649
...visit Lake-town...

853
01:27:58,900 --> 01:28:02,278
...see the Lonely Mountain again.

854
01:28:02,695 --> 01:28:07,617
But age, it seems,
has finally caught up with me.

855
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:21,506
I miss the Shire.

856
01:28:21,923 --> 01:28:27,053
I spent all my childhood pretending
I was off somewhere else.

857
01:28:27,386 --> 01:28:30,973
Off with you,
on one of your adventures.

858
01:28:33,935 --> 01:28:37,522
But my own adventure turned out
to be quite different.

859
01:28:42,735 --> 01:28:45,947
I'm not like you, Bilbo.

860
01:28:47,073 --> 01:28:49,408
My dear boy.

861
01:28:53,496 --> 01:28:57,458
- Now, what have I forgotten?
- Packed already?

862
01:28:58,251 --> 01:29:00,044
No harm in being prepared.

863
01:29:00,253 --> 01:29:02,839
- I thought you wanted to see the Elves.
- I do.

864
01:29:03,005 --> 01:29:05,925
- More than anything.
- I did.

865
01:29:06,092 --> 01:29:08,010
It's just...

866
01:29:08,761 --> 01:29:11,430
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?

867
01:29:11,597 --> 01:29:15,268
We got the Ring this far,
to Rivendell. And I thought...

868
01:29:15,476 --> 01:29:18,771
...seeing as how you're on the mend,
we'd be off soon.

869
01:29:18,980 --> 01:29:20,690
Off home.

870
01:29:24,861 --> 01:29:26,863
You are right, Sam.

871
01:29:29,031 --> 01:29:31,784
We did what we set out to do.

872
01:29:32,368 --> 01:29:34,954
The Ring will be safe in Rivendell.

873
01:29:39,041 --> 01:29:41,377
I am ready to go home.

874
01:29:42,128 --> 01:29:44,213
His strength returns.

875
01:29:44,380 --> 01:29:50,094
That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his life.

876
01:29:50,636 --> 01:29:53,222
And yet to have come so far
still bearing the Ring...

877
01:29:53,389 --> 01:29:57,101
...the Hobbit has shown extraordinary
resilience to its evil.

878
01:29:57,310 --> 01:30:00,646
It is a burden he should never
have had to bear.

879
01:30:00,897 --> 01:30:06,319
- We can ask no more of Frodo.
- Gandalf, the enemy is moving.

880
01:30:06,527 --> 01:30:11,157
Sauron's forces are massing in the East.
His Eye is fixed on Rivendell.

881
01:30:11,407 --> 01:30:14,160
And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.

882
01:30:14,327 --> 01:30:17,580
Our list of allies grows thin.

883
01:30:18,331 --> 01:30:21,125
His treachery runs deeper
than you know.

884
01:30:21,334 --> 01:30:25,004
By foul craft, Saruman
has crossed Orcs with Goblin-men.

885
01:30:25,171 --> 01:30:27,632
He's breeding an army
in the caverns of Isengard.

886
01:30:27,924 --> 01:30:32,511
An army that can move in sunlight
and cover great distance at speed.

887
01:30:32,678 --> 01:30:35,097
Saruman is coming for the Ring.

888
01:30:35,556 --> 01:30:39,602
This evil cannot be concealed
by the power of the Elves.

889
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:44,190
We do not have the strength
to fight both Mordor and Isengard!

890
01:30:48,027 --> 01:30:49,111
Gandalf...

891
01:30:50,446 --> 01:30:53,032
...the Ring cannot stay here.

892
01:31:12,551 --> 01:31:15,721
<i>This peril belongs
to all Middle-earth.</i>

893
01:31:15,972 --> 01:31:18,683
<i>They must decide now how to end it.</i>

894
01:31:19,725 --> 01:31:23,312
The time of the Elves is over.
My people are leaving these shores.

895
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:27,566
Who will you look to when we've gone?
The Dwarves?

896
01:31:27,733 --> 01:31:32,863
They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care not for the troubles of others.

897
01:31:34,490 --> 01:31:37,326
It is in Men
that we must place our hope.

898
01:31:37,660 --> 01:31:39,370
Men?

899
01:31:40,246 --> 01:31:43,499
Men are weak.
The race of Men is failing.

900
01:31:43,666 --> 01:31:48,129
The blood of Númenor is all but spent,
its pride and dignity forgotten.

901
01:31:48,421 --> 01:31:51,924
It is because of Men
the Ring survives.

902
01:31:52,133 --> 01:31:53,759
I was there, Gandalf.

903
01:31:54,427 --> 01:31:57,263
<i>I was there 3000 years ago...</i>

904
01:32:04,103 --> 01:32:06,522
<i>...when Isildur took the Ring.</i>

905
01:32:06,689 --> 01:32:10,609
I was there the day
the strength of Men failed.

906
01:32:13,154 --> 01:32:15,698
Isildur, hurry! Follow me.

907
01:32:17,283 --> 01:32:20,911
<i>I led Isildur into the heart
of Mount Doom...</i>

908
01:32:21,162 --> 01:32:24,707
<i>...where the Ring was forged,
the one place it could be destroyed.</i>

909
01:32:24,874 --> 01:32:27,460
Cast it into the fire!

910
01:32:32,631 --> 01:32:36,427
- Destroy it!
- No.

911
01:32:37,762 --> 01:32:39,930
Isildur!

912
01:32:40,389 --> 01:32:45,144
<i>It should have ended that day,
but evil was allowed to endure.</i>

913
01:32:49,231 --> 01:32:53,486
Isildur kept the Ring.
The line of kings is broken.

914
01:32:54,403 --> 01:32:58,074
There's no strength left
in the world of Men.

915
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:03,079
- They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
- There is one who could unite them.

916
01:33:03,287 --> 01:33:06,665
One who could reclaim
the throne of Gondor.

917
01:33:08,334 --> 01:33:12,171
He turned from that path
a long time ago.

918
01:33:12,338 --> 01:33:14,465
He has chosen exile.

919
01:33:45,704 --> 01:33:47,706
You are no Elf.

920
01:33:47,873 --> 01:33:49,959
Men of the South are welcome here.

921
01:33:50,543 --> 01:33:54,046
- Who are you?
- I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey.

922
01:33:55,548 --> 01:33:58,384
Then we are here on common purpose...

923
01:33:58,759 --> 01:34:00,219
...friend.

924
01:34:15,401 --> 01:34:18,320
The shards of Narsil.

925
01:34:21,782 --> 01:34:26,245
The blade that cut the Ring
from Sauron's hand.

926
01:34:29,165 --> 01:34:31,417
It's still sharp.

927
01:34:40,301 --> 01:34:43,387
But no more than a broken heirloom.

928
01:35:10,206 --> 01:35:13,250
Why do you fear the past?

929
01:35:14,126 --> 01:35:19,465
You are Isildur's heir,
not Isildur himself.

930
01:35:19,715 --> 01:35:23,135
You are not bound to his fate.

931
01:35:23,636 --> 01:35:27,640
The same blood flows in my veins.

932
01:35:30,643 --> 01:35:33,229
The same weakness.

933
01:35:35,940 --> 01:35:38,734
Your time will come.

934
01:35:38,943 --> 01:35:43,322
You will face the same evil.
And you will defeat it.

935
01:35:46,492 --> 01:35:48,869
The Shadow does not hold sway yet.

936
01:35:49,870 --> 01:35:53,499
Not over you... not over me.

937
01:36:04,843 --> 01:36:08,055
Do you remember when we first met?

938
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:16,188
I thought I had strayed into a dream.

939
01:36:16,689 --> 01:36:19,191
Long years have passed.

940
01:36:20,901 --> 01:36:24,280
You did not have the cares you carry now.

941
01:36:25,739 --> 01:36:27,783
Do you remember what I told you?

942
01:36:33,872 --> 01:36:36,542
You said you'd bind yourself to me...

943
01:36:38,544 --> 01:36:43,549
...forsaking the immortal life
of your people.

944
01:36:44,675 --> 01:36:46,552
And to that I hold.

945
01:36:46,719 --> 01:36:50,347
I would rather share
one lifetime with you...

946
01:36:50,597 --> 01:36:54,476
...than face all the Ages
of this world alone.

947
01:37:03,235 --> 01:37:06,697
I choose a mortal life.

948
01:37:08,032 --> 01:37:12,286
- You cannot give me this.
- It is mine to give to whom I will...

949
01:37:15,539 --> 01:37:18,042
...like my heart.

950
01:37:33,807 --> 01:37:37,519
Strangers from distant lands,
friends of old...

951
01:37:37,728 --> 01:37:41,648
...you've been summoned here
to answer the threat of Mordor.

952
01:37:42,274 --> 01:37:47,154
Middle-earth stands upon the brink
of destruction. None can escape it.

953
01:37:47,404 --> 01:37:50,908
You will unite, or you will fall.

954
01:37:51,116 --> 01:37:55,412
Each race is bound to this fate,
this one doom.

955
01:37:57,247 --> 01:38:00,751
Bring forth the Ring, Frodo.

956
01:38:14,807 --> 01:38:16,558
So it is true.

957
01:38:33,992 --> 01:38:36,120
In a dream...

958
01:38:37,704 --> 01:38:40,833
...I saw the eastern sky grow dark...

959
01:38:41,125 --> 01:38:42,835
...but in the West
a pale light lingered.

960
01:38:43,627 --> 01:38:45,379
A voice was crying:

961
01:38:45,671 --> 01:38:48,590
"Your doom is near at hand.

962
01:38:49,591 --> 01:38:52,344
Isildur's Bane is found."

963
01:38:56,348 --> 01:38:58,183
Isildur's Bane.

964
01:38:58,851 --> 01:39:00,144
Boromir!

965
01:39:23,333 --> 01:39:27,171
Never before has any voice uttered the
words of that tongue here in Imladris.

966
01:39:27,337 --> 01:39:31,049
I do not ask your pardon,
Master Elrond...

967
01:39:31,216 --> 01:39:33,343
...for the Black Speech of Mordor...

968
01:39:33,635 --> 01:39:35,012
...may yet be heard...

969
01:39:35,179 --> 01:39:38,182
...in every corner of the West!

970
01:39:38,348 --> 01:39:41,018
The Ring is altogether evil.

971
01:39:41,351 --> 01:39:42,853
It is a gift.

972
01:39:43,437 --> 01:39:45,522
A gift to the foes of Mordor.

973
01:39:46,148 --> 01:39:48,233
Why not use this Ring?

974
01:39:48,442 --> 01:39:51,195
Long has my father,
the Steward of Gondor...

975
01:39:51,403 --> 01:39:55,741
...kept the forces of Mordor at bay.
By the blood of our people...

976
01:39:56,033 --> 01:39:58,243
...are your lands kept safe.

977
01:40:00,037 --> 01:40:04,374
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.

978
01:40:04,666 --> 01:40:08,420
You cannot wield it.
None of us can.

979
01:40:09,046 --> 01:40:13,091
The One Ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master.

980
01:40:13,258 --> 01:40:16,803
And what would a Ranger know
of this matter?

981
01:40:17,095 --> 01:40:19,097
This is no mere Ranger.

982
01:40:20,098 --> 01:40:23,769
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

983
01:40:24,269 --> 01:40:27,189
You owe him your allegiance.

984
01:40:31,276 --> 01:40:33,195
Aragorn.

985
01:40:34,947 --> 01:40:37,783
This is Isildur's heir?

986
01:40:40,118 --> 01:40:42,829
And heir to the throne of Gondor.

987
01:40:44,957 --> 01:40:46,416
Sit down, Legolas.

988
01:40:49,795 --> 01:40:52,631
Gondor has no king.

989
01:40:54,466 --> 01:40:56,134
Gondor needs no king.

990
01:41:02,808 --> 01:41:06,478
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

991
01:41:07,479 --> 01:41:10,983
You have only one choice.

992
01:41:11,233 --> 01:41:13,610
The Ring must be destroyed.

993
01:41:18,824 --> 01:41:21,368
What are we waiting for?

994
01:41:33,505 --> 01:41:36,508
The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli,
son of Glóin...

995
01:41:36,758 --> 01:41:41,013
...by any craft that we here possess.

996
01:41:41,513 --> 01:41:45,684
The Ring was made in the fires
of Mount Doom.

997
01:41:45,851 --> 01:41:49,688
Only there can it be unmade.

998
01:41:50,731 --> 01:41:53,358
It must be taken deep into Mordor...

999
01:41:53,525 --> 01:41:58,530
...and cast back into the fiery chasm
from whence it came.

1000
01:42:00,532 --> 01:42:02,534
One of you...

1001
01:42:03,035 --> 01:42:05,203
...must do this.

1002
01:42:08,123 --> 01:42:11,835
One does not simply walk into Mordor.

1003
01:42:12,711 --> 01:42:16,381
Its Black Gates are guarded
by more than just Orcs.

1004
01:42:17,215 --> 01:42:21,345
There is evil there
that does not sleep.

1005
01:42:21,553 --> 01:42:25,766
The Great Eye is ever-watchful.

1006
01:42:26,558 --> 01:42:28,560
It is a barren wasteland...

1007
01:42:28,769 --> 01:42:32,397
...riddled with fire, and ash
and dust.

1008
01:42:32,564 --> 01:42:36,401
The very air you breathe
is a poisonous fume.

1009
01:42:36,652 --> 01:42:40,906
Not with 10,000 men
could you do this. It is folly.

1010
01:42:41,156 --> 01:42:45,577
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond
has said? The Ring must be destroyed.

1011
01:42:45,786 --> 01:42:48,413
And I suppose you think
you are the one to do it!

1012
01:42:48,580 --> 01:42:53,251
And if we fail, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

1013
01:42:53,418 --> 01:42:58,757
I will be dead before I see the Ring
in the hands of an Elf!

1014
01:43:00,759 --> 01:43:03,261
Never trust an Elf!

1015
01:43:04,429 --> 01:43:10,268
Do you not understand?
While you bicker, Sauron's power grows!

1016
01:43:10,602 --> 01:43:13,438
None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!

1017
01:43:32,249 --> 01:43:34,459
I will take it.

1018
01:43:36,461 --> 01:43:38,964
I will take it.

1019
01:43:44,803 --> 01:43:47,848
I will take the Ring to Mordor.

1020
01:43:55,897 --> 01:43:57,149
Though...

1021
01:44:00,235 --> 01:44:02,070
...I do not know the way.

1022
01:44:04,072 --> 01:44:08,410
I will help you bear
this burden, Frodo Baggins...

1023
01:44:08,577 --> 01:44:11,955
...as long as it is yours to bear.

1024
01:44:13,081 --> 01:44:16,168
If by my life
or death I can protect you...

1025
01:44:16,918 --> 01:44:18,253
...I will.

1026
01:44:21,465 --> 01:44:23,759
You have my sword.

1027
01:44:25,594 --> 01:44:27,679
And you have my bow.

1028
01:44:28,263 --> 01:44:30,766
And my ax.

1029
01:44:37,773 --> 01:44:40,776
You carry the fates
of us all, little one.

1030
01:44:42,778 --> 01:44:46,448
If this is indeed
the will of the Council...

1031
01:44:46,907 --> 01:44:49,326
- ...then Gondor will see it done.
- Hey!

1032
01:44:51,953 --> 01:44:56,708
- Frodo's not going anywhere without me.
- It is hardly possible to separate you...

1033
01:44:56,917 --> 01:45:01,797
...even when he is summoned
to a secret Council and you are not.

1034
01:45:02,297 --> 01:45:04,257
We're coming too!

1035
01:45:06,384 --> 01:45:09,137
You'll have to send us home
tied up in a sack to stop us.

1036
01:45:09,387 --> 01:45:12,724
Anyway, you need people
of intelligence on this sort of...

1037
01:45:13,058 --> 01:45:14,392
...mission.

1038
01:45:14,559 --> 01:45:16,061
Quest.

1039
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:17,562
Thing.

1040
01:45:19,397 --> 01:45:22,067
Well, that rules you out, Pip.

1041
01:45:23,652 --> 01:45:25,570
Nine companions.

1042
01:45:27,405 --> 01:45:29,241
So be it.

1043
01:45:29,574 --> 01:45:32,577
You shall be
the Fellowship of the Ring.

1044
01:45:33,245 --> 01:45:35,080
Great!

1045
01:45:35,288 --> 01:45:37,582
Where are we going?

1046
01:46:13,082 --> 01:46:15,626
She wanted to protect her child...

1047
01:46:17,461 --> 01:46:21,257
she thought in Rivendell
you would be safe.

1048
01:46:23,593 --> 01:46:27,096
In her heart, your mother
knew you'd be hunted all your life.

1049
01:46:27,597 --> 01:46:29,265
That you'd never escape your fate.

1050
01:46:29,765 --> 01:46:33,436
The skill of the Elves
can reforge the sword of kings...

1051
01:46:33,853 --> 01:46:37,773
...but only you have the power
to wield it.

1052
01:46:38,774 --> 01:46:41,277
I do not want that power.

1053
01:46:41,444 --> 01:46:44,113
I have never wanted it.

1054
01:46:45,448 --> 01:46:48,075
You are the last of that bloodline.
There is no other.

1055
01:46:52,455 --> 01:46:54,790
My old sword! Sting.

1056
01:46:54,999 --> 01:46:56,125
Here, take it. Take it.

1057
01:47:01,631 --> 01:47:05,593
- It's so light.
- Yes. Made by the Elves, you know.

1058
01:47:06,302 --> 01:47:10,389
The blade glows blue
when Orcs are close.

1059
01:47:10,598 --> 01:47:15,144
And it's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.

1060
01:47:15,353 --> 01:47:17,813
Here's a pretty thing.

1061
01:47:18,230 --> 01:47:19,523
Mithril.

1062
01:47:20,316 --> 01:47:24,695
As light as a feather,
and as hard as dragon scales.

1063
01:47:24,904 --> 01:47:28,157
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

1064
01:47:31,702 --> 01:47:33,162
Oh!

1065
01:47:36,207 --> 01:47:38,250
My old ring.

1066
01:47:39,502 --> 01:47:43,422
I should very much like...

1067
01:47:43,673 --> 01:47:47,677
...to hold it again, one last time.

1068
01:48:05,027 --> 01:48:08,698
I'm sorry I brought this upon you,
my boy.

1069
01:48:09,031 --> 01:48:13,160
I'm sorry that you
must carry this burden.

1070
01:48:17,665 --> 01:48:20,710
I'm sorry for everything.

1071
01:48:35,766 --> 01:48:39,937
The Ring-bearer is setting out
on the Quest of Mount Doom.

1072
01:48:41,272 --> 01:48:43,899
On you who travel with him,
no oath...

1073
01:48:44,108 --> 01:48:47,236
...nor bond is laid to go further
than you will.

1074
01:48:50,698 --> 01:48:53,242
Farewell. Hold to your purpose.

1075
01:48:53,701 --> 01:48:57,621
May the blessings of Elves and Men...

1076
01:48:58,164 --> 01:49:00,750
...and all Free Folk go with you.

1077
01:49:03,836 --> 01:49:07,923
The Fellowship awaits the Ring-bearer.

1078
01:49:26,358 --> 01:49:28,861
Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?

1079
01:49:29,403 --> 01:49:31,238
Left.

1080
01:50:50,734 --> 01:50:55,155
<i>We must hold to this course,
west of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.</i>

1081
01:50:55,364 --> 01:50:59,118
<i>If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan
will still be open to us.</i>

1082
01:50:59,326 --> 01:51:02,872
<i>From there, our road
turns east to Mordor.</i>

1083
01:51:03,038 --> 01:51:06,876
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.

1084
01:51:08,711 --> 01:51:09,753
Move your feet.

1085
01:51:09,962 --> 01:51:11,297
- You look good, Pippin.
- Thanks.

1086
01:51:11,505 --> 01:51:12,882
Faster!

1087
01:51:14,258 --> 01:51:18,053
If anyone was to ask for my opinion,
which I note they're not...

1088
01:51:18,262 --> 01:51:21,015
...I'd say we were taking
the long way 'round.

1089
01:51:21,515 --> 01:51:24,560
Gandalf, we could pass through
the Mines of Moria.

1090
01:51:25,227 --> 01:51:29,064
My cousin Balin would give us
a royal welcome.

1091
01:51:29,398 --> 01:51:34,778
No, I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.

1092
01:51:43,996 --> 01:51:45,080
Sorry!

1093
01:51:45,915 --> 01:51:47,416
Get him!

1094
01:51:48,751 --> 01:51:51,211
- For the Shire!
- Hold him. Hold him down, Merry!

1095
01:51:51,754 --> 01:51:54,089
Gentlemen, that's enough.

1096
01:51:57,885 --> 01:51:59,511
You've got my arm!
You've got my arm!

1097
01:51:59,929 --> 01:52:02,598
- What is that?
- Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.

1098
01:52:02,848 --> 01:52:05,559
It's moving fast.

1099
01:52:05,768 --> 01:52:07,937
Against the wind.

1100
01:52:08,729 --> 01:52:10,856
- Crebain from Dunland!
- Hide!

1101
01:52:11,065 --> 01:52:13,776
- Hurry!
- Take cover!

1102
01:52:47,184 --> 01:52:48,936
Spies of Saruman.

1103
01:52:49,687 --> 01:52:52,982
The passage south is being watched.

1104
01:52:54,149 --> 01:52:57,486
We must take the Pass of Caradhras.

1105
01:53:10,124 --> 01:53:11,834
Frodo!

1106
01:53:30,811 --> 01:53:33,063
Boromir.

1107
01:53:33,313 --> 01:53:37,526
It is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt...

1108
01:53:37,735 --> 01:53:40,863
...over so small a thing.

1109
01:53:44,074 --> 01:53:46,035
Such a little thing.

1110
01:53:46,243 --> 01:53:47,703
Boromir!

1111
01:53:48,328 --> 01:53:51,040
Give the Ring to Frodo.

1112
01:54:00,841 --> 01:54:02,885
As you wish.

1113
01:54:03,594 --> 01:54:05,596
I care not.

1114
01:54:41,006 --> 01:54:45,719
So, Gandalf, you try
to lead them over Caradhras.

1115
01:54:45,928 --> 01:54:50,516
And if that fails,
where then will you go?

1116
01:54:51,809 --> 01:54:54,770
<i>If the mountain defeats you...</i>

1117
01:54:55,020 --> 01:54:59,441
<i>...will you risk
a more dangerous road?</i>

1118
01:55:11,787 --> 01:55:14,665
There is a fell voice on the air.

1119
01:55:15,791 --> 01:55:17,292
It's Saruman!

1120
01:55:26,176 --> 01:55:30,848
He's trying to bring down the mountain!
Gandalf, we must turn back!

1121
01:55:31,140 --> 01:55:32,933
No!

1122
01:56:39,374 --> 01:56:41,210
We must get off the mountain!

1123
01:56:41,710 --> 01:56:46,048
Make for the Gap of Rohan,
and take the west road to my city!

1124
01:56:46,215 --> 01:56:49,551
The Gap of Rohan takes us
too close to Isengard!

1125
01:56:49,718 --> 01:56:53,472
We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.

1126
01:56:53,722 --> 01:56:56,558
Let us go through the Mines of Moria.

1127
01:56:58,393 --> 01:57:02,231
<i>Moria. You fear to go
into those mines.</i>

1128
01:57:02,898 --> 01:57:07,903
The Dwarves delved too greedily
and too deep.

1129
01:57:08,737 --> 01:57:13,617
<i>You know what they awoke
in the darkness of Khazad-dûm:</i>

1130
01:57:14,910 --> 01:57:18,413
Shadow and flame.

1131
01:57:21,750 --> 01:57:24,419
Let the Ring-bearer decide.

1132
01:57:29,132 --> 01:57:31,260
We cannot stay here!

1133
01:57:31,426 --> 01:57:34,263
This will be the death of the Hobbits.

1134
01:57:34,429 --> 01:57:36,139
Frodo?

1135
01:57:39,142 --> 01:57:42,020
We will go through the mines.

1136
01:57:42,771 --> 01:57:44,648
So be it.

1137
01:57:51,321 --> 01:57:55,284
Frodo, come and help an old man.

1138
01:57:58,787 --> 01:58:00,998
How is your shoulder?

1139
01:58:01,206 --> 01:58:04,459
- Better than it was.
- And the Ring?

1140
01:58:06,003 --> 01:58:08,505
You feel its power growing, don't you?

1141
01:58:09,006 --> 01:58:11,925
I've felt it too.
You must be careful now.

1142
01:58:12,342 --> 01:58:16,263
Evil will be drawn to you
from outside the Fellowship.

1143
01:58:16,430 --> 01:58:19,016
And, I fear, from within.

1144
01:58:21,643 --> 01:58:25,814
- Who then do I trust?
- You must trust yourself.

1145
01:58:25,981 --> 01:58:28,859
Trust your own strengths.

1146
01:58:29,026 --> 01:58:31,611
- What do you mean?
- There are many powers in this world...

1147
01:58:31,820 --> 01:58:33,864
...for good or for evil.

1148
01:58:34,031 --> 01:58:36,325
Some are greater than I am.

1149
01:58:36,867 --> 01:58:40,495
And against some I have not yet
been tested.

1150
01:58:41,872 --> 01:58:43,248
The walls...

1151
01:58:43,957 --> 01:58:46,043
...of Moria.

1152
01:58:51,757 --> 01:58:54,760
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

1153
01:58:54,968 --> 01:58:59,389
Their own masters cannot find
them if their secrets are forgotten.

1154
01:58:59,765 --> 01:59:02,267
Why doesn't that surprise me?

1155
01:59:10,275 --> 01:59:13,570
Well, let's see.

1156
01:59:13,779 --> 01:59:15,155
Ithildin.

1157
01:59:15,781 --> 01:59:19,159
It mirrors only starlight
and moonlight.

1158
01:59:33,215 --> 01:59:37,302
It reads, "The Doors of Durin,
Lord of Moria.

1159
01:59:37,886 --> 01:59:42,516
- Speak, friend, and enter."
- What do you suppose that means?

1160
01:59:42,724 --> 01:59:47,521
It's simple. If you are a friend, you speak
the password and the doors will open.

1161
02:00:11,253 --> 02:00:12,421
Nothing's happening.

1162
02:00:19,428 --> 02:00:23,640
I once knew every spell
in all the tongues of Elves...

1163
02:00:23,974 --> 02:00:26,768
...Men and Orcs.

1164
02:00:27,060 --> 02:00:28,270
What are you going to do, then?

1165
02:00:28,478 --> 02:00:30,730
Knock your head against these doors,
Peregrin Took!

1166
02:00:30,981 --> 02:00:32,941
And if that does not shatter them...

1167
02:00:33,150 --> 02:00:35,861
...and I am allowed a little peace
from foolish questions...

1168
02:00:36,027 --> 02:00:39,489
...I will try to find the opening words.

1169
02:00:52,335 --> 02:00:54,880
Mines are no place for a pony.

1170
02:00:55,088 --> 02:00:59,176
- Even one so brave as Bill.
- Bye-bye, Bill.

1171
02:01:00,343 --> 02:01:03,138
Go on, Bill. Go on.

1172
02:01:03,680 --> 02:01:07,225
Don't worry, Sam,
he knows the way home.

1173
02:01:14,024 --> 02:01:16,610
Do not disturb the water.

1174
02:01:16,818 --> 02:01:18,695
Oh, it's useless.

1175
02:01:31,374 --> 02:01:33,543
It's a riddle.

1176
02:01:36,296 --> 02:01:39,424
"Speak 'friend' and enter."

1177
02:01:39,799 --> 02:01:42,719
What's the Elvish word for "friend"?

1178
02:01:44,179 --> 02:01:45,514
<i>Mellon.</i>

1179
02:02:03,532 --> 02:02:08,411
Soon, Master Elf, you will enjoy
the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves.

1180
02:02:08,870 --> 02:02:14,584
Roaring fires, malt beer,
ripe meat off the bone!

1181
02:02:16,086 --> 02:02:19,172
This, my friend,
is the home of my cousin Balin.

1182
02:02:19,548 --> 02:02:21,925
And they call it a mine.

1183
02:02:22,133 --> 02:02:24,094
A mine!

1184
02:02:25,136 --> 02:02:28,473
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

1185
02:02:32,727 --> 02:02:34,187
No.

1186
02:02:34,604 --> 02:02:36,189
No...

1187
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:39,109
No!

1188
02:02:41,736 --> 02:02:43,280
Goblins.

1189
02:02:47,200 --> 02:02:51,496
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.

1190
02:02:52,581 --> 02:02:55,125
Now, get out of here. Get out!

1191
02:02:57,919 --> 02:03:00,297
- Frodo!
- Help!

1192
02:03:00,505 --> 02:03:02,132
Strider!

1193
02:03:02,299 --> 02:03:05,093
- Help!
- Get off him!

1194
02:03:05,260 --> 02:03:06,303
Aragorn!

1195
02:03:16,730 --> 02:03:17,772
Frodo!

1196
02:03:18,940 --> 02:03:20,525
Strider!

1197
02:03:44,132 --> 02:03:45,175
Into the mines!

1198
02:03:45,342 --> 02:03:48,553
- Legolas!
- Into the cave!

1199
02:03:52,849 --> 02:03:54,643
Run!

1200
02:04:11,493 --> 02:04:15,080
We now have but one choice.

1201
02:04:15,288 --> 02:04:20,168
We must face the long dark of Moria.

1202
02:04:20,418 --> 02:04:22,379
Be on your guard.

1203
02:04:22,587 --> 02:04:26,049
There are older
and fouler things than Orcs...

1204
02:04:26,216 --> 02:04:29,761
...in the deep places of the world.

1205
02:04:37,727 --> 02:04:41,690
Quietly now. It's a four-day journey
to the other side.

1206
02:04:41,856 --> 02:04:45,694
Let us hope that our presence
may go unnoticed.

1207
02:05:31,489 --> 02:05:35,201
The wealth of Moria is not in gold...

1208
02:05:35,368 --> 02:05:37,787
...or jewels...

1209
02:05:37,954 --> 02:05:40,999
...but mithril.

1210
02:05:59,350 --> 02:06:04,272
Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings
that Thorin gave him.

1211
02:06:04,481 --> 02:06:08,443
- Oh, that was a kingly gift.
- Yes.

1212
02:06:08,610 --> 02:06:10,528
I never told him...

1213
02:06:10,695 --> 02:06:15,658
...but its worth was greater than
the value of the Shire.

1214
02:06:28,004 --> 02:06:29,714
Pippin.

1215
02:06:50,401 --> 02:06:53,029
I have no memory of this place.

1216
02:06:55,114 --> 02:06:56,616
- Are we lost?
- No.

1217
02:06:56,825 --> 02:06:59,327
- I think we are.
- Gandalf's thinking.

1218
02:06:59,494 --> 02:07:00,954
- Merry?
- What?

1219
02:07:01,246 --> 02:07:03,206
I'm hungry.

1220
02:07:14,509 --> 02:07:18,972
- There's something down there.
- It's Gollum.

1221
02:07:19,180 --> 02:07:23,309
- Gollum?
- He's been following us for three days.

1222
02:07:23,518 --> 02:07:27,689
- He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dûr?
- Escaped...

1223
02:07:28,356 --> 02:07:30,024
...or was set loose.

1224
02:07:30,525 --> 02:07:34,195
Now the Ring has brought him here.

1225
02:07:36,823 --> 02:07:39,534
He will never be rid of his need for it.

1226
02:07:39,701 --> 02:07:45,498
He hates and loves the Ring,
as he hates and loves himself.

1227
02:07:45,665 --> 02:07:50,545
Sméagol's life is a sad story.

1228
02:07:50,712 --> 02:07:56,676
Yes, Sméagol he was once called.
Before the Ring found him.

1229
02:07:57,552 --> 02:08:00,388
Before it drove him mad.

1230
02:08:00,680 --> 02:08:03,558
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him
when he had the chance.

1231
02:08:03,725 --> 02:08:04,934
Pity?

1232
02:08:06,019 --> 02:08:08,897
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

1233
02:08:09,814 --> 02:08:15,028
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.

1234
02:08:16,446 --> 02:08:18,907
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

1235
02:08:21,367 --> 02:08:25,330
Do not be too eager
to deal out death and judgment.

1236
02:08:25,538 --> 02:08:28,416
Even the very wise
cannot see all ends.

1237
02:08:29,042 --> 02:08:34,923
My heart tells me that Gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill...

1238
02:08:35,757 --> 02:08:38,593
...before this is over.

1239
02:08:40,094 --> 02:08:43,932
The pity of Bilbo
may rule the fate of many.

1240
02:08:50,605 --> 02:08:53,942
I wish the Ring
had never come to me.

1241
02:08:55,401 --> 02:08:57,445
I wish none of this had happened.

1242
02:08:57,612 --> 02:09:02,659
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.

1243
02:09:03,451 --> 02:09:08,957
All we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us.

1244
02:09:10,458 --> 02:09:14,462
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.

1245
02:09:14,879 --> 02:09:17,298
Bilbo was meant to find the Ring.

1246
02:09:17,799 --> 02:09:22,136
In which case,
you also were meant to have it.

1247
02:09:22,303 --> 02:09:25,473
And that is an encouraging thought.

1248
02:09:28,434 --> 02:09:29,602
Ah!

1249
02:09:30,395 --> 02:09:32,313
It's that way.

1250
02:09:32,480 --> 02:09:34,816
- He's remembered.
- No.

1251
02:09:34,983 --> 02:09:38,820
But the air doesn't smell
so foul down here.

1252
02:09:38,987 --> 02:09:44,200
If in doubt, Meriadoc,
always follow your nose.

1253
02:09:59,007 --> 02:10:03,177
Let me risk a little more light.

1254
02:10:07,849 --> 02:10:09,934
Behold...

1255
02:10:10,351 --> 02:10:15,565
...the great realm
and Dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.

1256
02:10:18,026 --> 02:10:21,487
There's an eye opener, and no mistake.

1257
02:10:46,387 --> 02:10:48,097
Gimli!

1258
02:10:53,895 --> 02:10:55,354
No.

1259
02:10:55,563 --> 02:10:57,190
No!

1260
02:10:59,734 --> 02:11:02,904
Oh, no.

1261
02:11:04,739 --> 02:11:06,032
No.

1262
02:11:13,289 --> 02:11:15,291
"Here lies Balin...

1263
02:11:15,750 --> 02:11:17,752
...son of Fundin...

1264
02:11:18,086 --> 02:11:20,713
...Lord of Moria."

1265
02:11:21,756 --> 02:11:23,424
He is dead, then.

1266
02:11:25,593 --> 02:11:26,803
It's as I feared.

1267
02:11:45,113 --> 02:11:48,032
We must move on. We cannot linger.

1268
02:11:48,241 --> 02:11:52,954
"They have taken the bridge
and the second hall.

1269
02:11:54,038 --> 02:11:56,624
We have barred the gates...

1270
02:11:57,291 --> 02:11:59,794
...but cannot hold them for long.

1271
02:11:59,961 --> 02:12:02,797
The ground shakes.

1272
02:12:03,172 --> 02:12:04,799
Drums...

1273
02:12:05,133 --> 02:12:08,553
...drums in the deep.

1274
02:12:12,098 --> 02:12:14,142
We cannot get out.

1275
02:12:16,144 --> 02:12:19,981
A Shadow moves in the dark.

1276
02:12:21,649 --> 02:12:24,193
We cannot get out.

1277
02:12:27,196 --> 02:12:29,157
They are coming."

1278
02:13:12,200 --> 02:13:14,035
Fool of a Took!

1279
02:13:14,368 --> 02:13:18,206
Throw yourself in next time,
and rid us of your stupidity.

1280
02:13:44,148 --> 02:13:45,775
Frodo!

1281
02:13:48,069 --> 02:13:49,570
Orcs.

1282
02:13:56,577 --> 02:13:58,579
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

1283
02:14:05,878 --> 02:14:07,672
They have a cave-troll.

1284
02:14:23,437 --> 02:14:24,605
Let them come!

1285
02:14:25,106 --> 02:14:28,693
There is one Dwarf yet in Moria
who still draws breath.

1286
02:16:47,581 --> 02:16:50,334
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

1287
02:16:55,089 --> 02:16:56,757
Frodo!

1288
02:17:30,291 --> 02:17:32,126
Aragorn! Aragorn!

1289
02:17:33,127 --> 02:17:35,004
Frodo!

1290
02:18:20,174 --> 02:18:22,051
Frodo!

1291
02:18:24,845 --> 02:18:26,305
Frodo!

1292
02:19:22,278 --> 02:19:23,571
Oh, no.

1293
02:19:31,996 --> 02:19:33,872
He's alive.

1294
02:19:36,292 --> 02:19:39,295
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

1295
02:19:39,587 --> 02:19:41,797
You should be dead.

1296
02:19:42,006 --> 02:19:44,508
That spear would have skewered
a wild boar.

1297
02:19:44,758 --> 02:19:49,513
I think there's more to this Hobbit
than meets the eye.

1298
02:19:55,311 --> 02:19:56,437
Mithril.

1299
02:19:59,231 --> 02:20:01,817
You are full of surprises,
Master Baggins.

1300
02:20:07,823 --> 02:20:09,783
To the Bridge of Khazad-dûm!

1301
02:20:24,757 --> 02:20:26,342
This way!

1302
02:21:36,745 --> 02:21:39,748
What is this new devilry?

1303
02:21:55,848 --> 02:21:58,642
A Balrog.

1304
02:21:58,934 --> 02:22:02,062
A demon of the ancient world.

1305
02:22:04,273 --> 02:22:06,734
This foe is beyond any of you.

1306
02:22:07,901 --> 02:22:09,445
Run!

1307
02:22:16,785 --> 02:22:18,287
Quickly!

1308
02:22:34,928 --> 02:22:36,180
Gandalf.

1309
02:22:36,805 --> 02:22:38,432
Lead them on, Aragorn.

1310
02:22:39,808 --> 02:22:42,311
The bridge is near.

1311
02:22:44,396 --> 02:22:48,484
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.

1312
02:23:17,638 --> 02:23:19,348
Gandalf!

1313
02:23:37,658 --> 02:23:38,867
Merry! Pippin!

1314
02:23:50,003 --> 02:23:51,505
Sam!

1315
02:23:54,258 --> 02:23:57,511
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.

1316
02:24:00,514 --> 02:24:01,974
Not the beard!

1317
02:24:15,195 --> 02:24:17,072
Steady.

1318
02:24:19,199 --> 02:24:20,868
Hold on!

1319
02:24:41,889 --> 02:24:43,098
Hang on!

1320
02:24:53,901 --> 02:24:55,611
Lean forward!

1321
02:24:58,572 --> 02:24:59,615
Steady.

1322
02:25:00,949 --> 02:25:02,117
Come on!

1323
02:25:02,367 --> 02:25:03,869
Now!

1324
02:25:21,094 --> 02:25:22,888
Over the bridge!

1325
02:25:23,096 --> 02:25:24,640
Fly!

1326
02:26:09,309 --> 02:26:11,353
You cannot pass!

1327
02:26:11,520 --> 02:26:13,146
Gandalf!

1328
02:26:17,401 --> 02:26:22,280
I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

1329
02:26:23,281 --> 02:26:27,035
The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udûn!

1330
02:26:37,045 --> 02:26:39,006
Go back to the Shadow.

1331
02:26:46,847 --> 02:26:51,309
You shall not pass!

1332
02:27:18,462 --> 02:27:22,340
- No! No!
- Gandalf!

1333
02:27:30,015 --> 02:27:32,476
Fly, you fools!

1334
02:27:36,605 --> 02:27:38,774
No!

1335
02:27:44,905 --> 02:27:47,074
Aragorn!

1336
02:28:44,339 --> 02:28:47,175
Legolas, get them up.

1337
02:28:51,304 --> 02:28:53,140
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

1338
02:28:53,306 --> 02:28:56,935
By nightfall, these hills will
be swarming with Orcs.

1339
02:28:57,144 --> 02:29:00,480
We must reach the woods of Lothlórien.

1340
02:29:01,356 --> 02:29:04,651
Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.

1341
02:29:06,153 --> 02:29:08,363
On your feet, Sam.

1342
02:29:08,697 --> 02:29:10,198
Frodo?

1343
02:29:12,284 --> 02:29:13,994
Frodo!

1344
02:30:06,504 --> 02:30:09,049
Stay close, young Hobbits!

1345
02:30:09,758 --> 02:30:13,887
They say that a great sorceress
lives in these woods.

1346
02:30:14,137 --> 02:30:16,681
An Elf-witch...

1347
02:30:17,224 --> 02:30:20,060
...of terrible power.

1348
02:30:20,644 --> 02:30:22,854
All who look upon her...

1349
02:30:23,063 --> 02:30:24,856
...fall under her spell.

1350
02:30:25,065 --> 02:30:26,358
<i>Frodo!</i>

1351
02:30:28,610 --> 02:30:30,654
And are never seen again.

1352
02:30:30,862 --> 02:30:35,367
<i>Your coming to us is
as the footsteps of doom.</i>

1353
02:30:35,575 --> 02:30:39,246
<i>You bring great evil here,
Ring-bearer.</i>

1354
02:30:39,454 --> 02:30:41,248
Mr. Frodo?

1355
02:30:46,544 --> 02:30:52,092
Well, here's one Dwarf
she won't ensnare so easily.

1356
02:30:52,300 --> 02:30:56,888
I have the eyes of a hawk
and the ears of a fox.

1357
02:31:04,562 --> 02:31:09,109
The Dwarf breathes so loud,
we could have shot him in the dark.

1358
02:31:14,281 --> 02:31:16,324
Welcome Legolas, son of Thranduil.

1359
02:31:17,200 --> 02:31:19,911
Our Fellowship stands in your debt.

1360
02:31:22,706 --> 02:31:24,416
Aragorn of the Dunedain...

1361
02:31:25,041 --> 02:31:26,459
you are known to us.

1362
02:31:27,294 --> 02:31:29,587
So much for the legendary courtesy
of the Elves!

1363
02:31:29,754 --> 02:31:31,631
Speak words we can all understand!

1364
02:31:31,798 --> 02:31:36,428
We have not had dealings
with the Dwarves since the Dark Days.

1365
02:31:36,720 --> 02:31:39,222
And you know what this Dwarf
says to that?

1366
02:31:46,146 --> 02:31:48,106
That was not so courteous.

1367
02:31:54,654 --> 02:31:58,658
You bring great evil with you.

1368
02:32:00,452 --> 02:32:02,662
You can go no further.

1369
02:32:39,908 --> 02:32:42,535
Gandalf's death was not in vain.

1370
02:32:43,703 --> 02:32:45,580
Nor would he have you give up hope.

1371
02:32:47,082 --> 02:32:50,418
You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.

1372
02:32:51,294 --> 02:32:54,381
Don't carry the weight of the dead.

1373
02:32:57,384 --> 02:32:59,386
You will follow me.

1374
02:33:11,106 --> 02:33:13,066
Caras Galadhon.

1375
02:33:13,733 --> 02:33:16,694
The heart of Elvendom on earth.

1376
02:33:16,861 --> 02:33:22,534
Realm of the Lord Celeborn
and of Galadriel, Lady of Light.

1377
02:34:41,529 --> 02:34:44,657
The enemy knows you have entered here.

1378
02:34:45,325 --> 02:34:50,497
What hope you had in secrecy
is now gone.

1379
02:34:52,207 --> 02:34:56,669
Eight there are here, yet nine there
were set out from Rivendell.

1380
02:34:56,920 --> 02:34:58,713
Tell me, where is Gandalf?

1381
02:34:58,922 --> 02:35:02,008
For I much desire to speak with him.

1382
02:35:02,175 --> 02:35:05,011
I can no longer see him from afar.

1383
02:35:05,845 --> 02:35:11,017
Gandalf the Grey did not
pass the borders of this land.

1384
02:35:11,309 --> 02:35:13,728
He has fallen into Shadow.

1385
02:35:18,441 --> 02:35:22,946
He was taken by both Shadow and flame.

1386
02:35:24,572 --> 02:35:28,326
A Balrog of Morgoth.

1387
02:35:29,035 --> 02:35:32,372
For we went needlessly
into the net of Moria.

1388
02:35:34,541 --> 02:35:37,752
Needless were none of the deeds
of Gandalf in life.

1389
02:35:38,378 --> 02:35:41,714
We do not yet know his full purpose.

1390
02:35:46,469 --> 02:35:50,765
Do not let the great emptiness
of Khazad-dûm fill your heart...

1391
02:35:51,057 --> 02:35:53,393
...Gimli, son of Glóin.

1392
02:35:54,394 --> 02:35:57,897
For the world has grown
full of peril...

1393
02:35:59,399 --> 02:36:02,068
...and in all lands...

1394
02:36:02,235 --> 02:36:05,738
...love is now mingled with grief.

1395
02:36:18,376 --> 02:36:21,087
What now becomes of this Fellowship?

1396
02:36:21,588 --> 02:36:24,591
Without Gandalf, hope is lost.

1397
02:36:27,594 --> 02:36:30,888
The quest stands upon the edge
of a knife.

1398
02:36:31,055 --> 02:36:34,100
Stray but a little and it will fail...

1399
02:36:34,892 --> 02:36:37,729
...to the ruin of all.

1400
02:36:42,066 --> 02:36:47,905
Yet hope remains
while the Company is true.

1401
02:36:49,449 --> 02:36:54,120
Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Go now and rest...

1402
02:36:54,621 --> 02:36:58,291
...for you are weary with sorrow
and much toil.

1403
02:37:00,543 --> 02:37:02,629
Tonight, you will sleep...

1404
02:37:02,795 --> 02:37:06,257
<i>Welcome, Frodo of the Shire...</i>

1405
02:37:07,800 --> 02:37:09,636
<i>...one who has seen the Eye!</i>

1406
02:37:24,275 --> 02:37:26,819
A lament for Gandalf.

1407
02:37:34,118 --> 02:37:35,662
What do they say about him?

1408
02:37:35,870 --> 02:37:38,498
I have not the heart to tell you.

1409
02:37:41,292 --> 02:37:43,503
For me, the grief is still too near.

1410
02:37:46,506 --> 02:37:49,342
I bet they don't mention his fireworks.

1411
02:37:49,509 --> 02:37:52,512
There should be a verse about them.

1412
02:37:56,099 --> 02:37:58,101
<i>The finest rockets ever seen</i>

1413
02:37:59,185 --> 02:38:02,021
<i>They burst in stars of blue and green</i>

1414
02:38:02,980 --> 02:38:06,401
<i>Or after thunder, silver showers</i>

1415
02:38:08,861 --> 02:38:11,698
<i>Came falling like a rain of flowers</i>

1416
02:38:11,864 --> 02:38:15,743
Oh, that doesn't do them justice
by a long road.

1417
02:38:26,546 --> 02:38:29,215
Take some rest.

1418
02:38:29,424 --> 02:38:32,135
These borders are well-protected.

1419
02:38:32,343 --> 02:38:34,887
I will find no rest here.

1420
02:38:37,724 --> 02:38:40,727
I heard her voice inside my head.

1421
02:38:40,935 --> 02:38:44,689
She spoke of my father
and the fall of Gondor.

1422
02:38:44,897 --> 02:38:50,361
She said to me,
"Even now there is hope left."

1423
02:38:51,738 --> 02:38:54,574
But I cannot see it.

1424
02:38:55,908 --> 02:38:58,411
It is long since we had any hope.

1425
02:39:08,588 --> 02:39:10,715
My father is a noble man.

1426
02:39:11,466 --> 02:39:13,718
But his rule is failing...

1427
02:39:14,051 --> 02:39:19,432
...and our people lose faith.

1428
02:39:20,892 --> 02:39:24,437
He looks to me to make things right,
and I would do it.

1429
02:39:24,604 --> 02:39:28,107
I would see the glory
of Gondor restored.

1430
02:39:30,943 --> 02:39:33,946
Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?

1431
02:39:34,614 --> 02:39:36,616
The White Tower of Ecthelion.

1432
02:39:36,783 --> 02:39:40,620
Glimmering like a spike
of pearl and silver.

1433
02:39:41,287 --> 02:39:44,791
Its banners caught high
in the morning breeze.

1434
02:39:47,710 --> 02:39:49,670
Have you ever been called home...

1435
02:39:49,837 --> 02:39:53,800
...by the clear ringing
of silver trumpets?

1436
02:39:54,425 --> 02:39:57,637
I have seen the White City...

1437
02:39:57,970 --> 02:39:59,472
...long ago.

1438
02:40:00,473 --> 02:40:05,436
One day, our paths will lead us there.

1439
02:40:06,354 --> 02:40:09,315
And the tower guard
shall take up the call:

1440
02:40:09,774 --> 02:40:13,110
"The Lords of Gondor have returned."

1441
02:41:20,303 --> 02:41:22,847
Will you look into the mirror?

1442
02:41:23,014 --> 02:41:24,557
What will I see?

1443
02:41:27,518 --> 02:41:29,854
Even the wisest cannot tell.

1444
02:41:30,730 --> 02:41:32,565
For the mirror...

1445
02:41:32,815 --> 02:41:35,359
...shows many things.

1446
02:41:38,362 --> 02:41:40,740
Things that were...

1447
02:41:40,948 --> 02:41:43,534
...things that are...

1448
02:41:44,327 --> 02:41:46,245
...and some things...

1449
02:41:49,832 --> 02:41:53,127
...that have not yet come to pass.

1450
02:43:15,668 --> 02:43:18,504
I know what it is you saw.

1451
02:43:20,965 --> 02:43:23,467
For it is also in my mind.

1452
02:43:25,219 --> 02:43:29,306
<i>It is what will come to pass
if you should fail.</i>

1453
02:43:31,684 --> 02:43:36,522
<i>The Fellowship is breaking.
It is already begun.</i>

1454
02:43:37,189 --> 02:43:40,484
<i>He will try to take the Ring.</i>

1455
02:43:40,693 --> 02:43:42,695
<i>You know of whom I speak.</i>

1456
02:43:43,696 --> 02:43:48,367
<i>One by one, it will destroy them all.</i>

1457
02:43:49,869 --> 02:43:52,329
<i>If you ask it of me...</i>

1458
02:43:52,705 --> 02:43:55,750
<i>...I will give you the One Ring.</i>

1459
02:43:56,834 --> 02:43:59,003
You offer it to me freely.

1460
02:44:03,549 --> 02:44:07,511
I do not deny that my heart
has greatly desired this.

1461
02:44:13,893 --> 02:44:17,188
In place of a Dark Lord,
you would have a queen...

1462
02:44:17,605 --> 02:44:21,400
...not dark but beautiful,
and terrible as the dawn!

1463
02:44:22,068 --> 02:44:25,071
Treacherous as the sea!

1464
02:44:25,571 --> 02:44:30,534
Stronger than the foundations
of the earth!

1465
02:44:30,993 --> 02:44:33,370
All shall love me...

1466
02:44:33,579 --> 02:44:36,415
...and despair.

1467
02:44:50,513 --> 02:44:54,809
I pass the test. I will diminish...

1468
02:44:55,101 --> 02:44:57,561
...and go into the West...

1469
02:44:57,770 --> 02:45:02,233
- ...and remain Galadriel.
- I cannot do this alone.

1470
02:45:05,820 --> 02:45:09,949
You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo.
To bear a Ring of Power...

1471
02:45:10,908 --> 02:45:12,409
...is to be alone.

1472
02:45:15,746 --> 02:45:18,457
This is Nenya,
the Ring of Adamant.

1473
02:45:18,666 --> 02:45:20,292
And I am its keeper.

1474
02:45:23,462 --> 02:45:27,133
This task was appointed to you.

1475
02:45:28,134 --> 02:45:31,053
And if you do not find a way...

1476
02:45:32,263 --> 02:45:34,265
...no one will.

1477
02:45:34,640 --> 02:45:37,810
Then I know what I must do.

1478
02:45:38,477 --> 02:45:39,645
It's just...

1479
02:45:42,940 --> 02:45:45,151
...I'm afraid to do it.

1480
02:45:48,654 --> 02:45:53,826
Even the smallest person can change
the course of the future.

1481
02:45:59,165 --> 02:46:04,879
Do you know how the Orcs
first came into being?

1482
02:46:05,671 --> 02:46:09,008
They were Elves once.

1483
02:46:10,176 --> 02:46:13,512
Taken by the Dark Powers...

1484
02:46:13,679 --> 02:46:16,849
...tortured and mutilated.

1485
02:46:17,183 --> 02:46:22,521
A ruined and terrible form of life.

1486
02:46:22,813 --> 02:46:24,648
And now...

1487
02:46:26,108 --> 02:46:27,985
...perfected.

1488
02:46:28,694 --> 02:46:31,864
My fighting Uruk-hai...

1489
02:46:33,824 --> 02:46:36,160
...whom do you serve?

1490
02:46:36,368 --> 02:46:38,871
Saruman!

1491
02:46:59,725 --> 02:47:03,187
Hunt them down. Do not stop
until they are found.

1492
02:47:03,395 --> 02:47:06,273
You do not know pain.
You do not know fear.

1493
02:47:06,523 --> 02:47:09,401
You will taste Man-flesh!

1494
02:47:14,531 --> 02:47:18,244
One of the halflings carries
something of great value.

1495
02:47:18,410 --> 02:47:22,581
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.

1496
02:47:24,416 --> 02:47:25,709
Kill the others.

1497
02:47:44,895 --> 02:47:50,317
Never before have we clad
strangers in the garb of our own people.

1498
02:47:51,443 --> 02:47:55,281
May these cloaks help shield you
from unfriendly eyes.

1499
02:48:02,454 --> 02:48:03,998
Lembas.

1500
02:48:04,248 --> 02:48:05,833
Elvish waybread.

1501
02:48:08,335 --> 02:48:11,338
One small bite is enough to fill
the stomach of a grown man.

1502
02:48:17,803 --> 02:48:19,805
How many did you eat?

1503
02:48:19,972 --> 02:48:21,640
Four.

1504
02:48:27,438 --> 02:48:30,024
<i>Every league you travel south,
the danger will increase.</i>

1505
02:48:30,232 --> 02:48:34,320
<i>Mordor Orcs now hold the eastern shore
of the Anduin.</i>

1506
02:48:34,486 --> 02:48:36,989
<i>Nor will you find safety
on the western bank.</i>

1507
02:48:37,239 --> 02:48:41,035
Strange creatures bearing the White Hand
have been seen on our borders.

1508
02:48:41,243 --> 02:48:46,332
Seldom do Orcs journey in the open
under the sun, yet these have done so.

1509
02:48:55,007 --> 02:48:57,634
You are being tracked.

1510
02:48:59,011 --> 02:49:00,262
By river you have the chance...

1511
02:49:00,429 --> 02:49:03,640
...of outrunning the enemy
to the Falls of Rauros.

1512
02:49:20,908 --> 02:49:25,704
My gift for you, Legolas,
is a bow of the Galadhrim.

1513
02:49:25,996 --> 02:49:29,500
Worthy of the skill
of our woodland kin.

1514
02:49:34,880 --> 02:49:37,341
These are the daggers of the Noldorin.

1515
02:49:37,508 --> 02:49:40,719
They have already seen service in war.

1516
02:49:40,886 --> 02:49:43,931
Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.

1517
02:49:44,098 --> 02:49:47,393
<i>You will find your courage.</i>

1518
02:49:49,311 --> 02:49:51,271
<i>And for you, Samwise Gamgee...</i>

1519
02:49:51,438 --> 02:49:54,024
...Elven rope made of hithlain.

1520
02:49:54,191 --> 02:49:56,318
Thank you, my lady.

1521
02:49:58,112 --> 02:50:01,448
Have you run out
of those nice, shiny daggers?

1522
02:50:07,913 --> 02:50:10,916
And what gift would a dwarf ask
of the Elves?

1523
02:50:11,083 --> 02:50:13,252
Nothing.

1524
02:50:13,877 --> 02:50:17,214
Except to look upon the lady
of the Galadhrim one last time...

1525
02:50:17,840 --> 02:50:23,053
...for she is more fair
than all the jewels beneath the earth.

1526
02:50:30,102 --> 02:50:31,645
Actually...

1527
02:50:31,854 --> 02:50:33,439
There was one thing.

1528
02:50:34,273 --> 02:50:36,942
No, no, I'm talking nonsense.
It's quite impossible.

1529
02:50:37,109 --> 02:50:39,945
<i>Stupid to ask.</i>

1530
02:50:42,448 --> 02:50:44,616
<i>I have nothing greater to give...</i>

1531
02:50:44,783 --> 02:50:48,370
...than the gift you already bear.

1532
02:50:49,580 --> 02:50:50,622
For her love,

1533
02:50:51,915 --> 02:50:57,254
I fear the grace of Arwen Evenstar
will diminish.

1534
02:50:58,005 --> 02:51:01,341
I would have her leave these shores,

1535
02:51:02,885 --> 02:51:05,804
and be with her people.

1536
02:51:07,806 --> 02:51:13,520
I would have her take the ship to Valinor.

1537
02:51:14,021 --> 02:51:17,107
That choice is yet before her.

1538
02:51:17,691 --> 02:51:20,611
You have your own choice to make,
Aragorn.

1539
02:51:20,944 --> 02:51:26,783
To rise above the height of all
your fathers since the days of Elendil...

1540
02:51:26,950 --> 02:51:31,288
...or to fall into darkness
with all that is left of your kin.

1541
02:51:38,420 --> 02:51:39,796
Farewell.

1542
02:51:43,592 --> 02:51:46,970
There is much you have yet to do.

1543
02:51:53,477 --> 02:51:54,728
We shall not meet again...

1544
02:51:54,937 --> 02:51:56,313
Elessar.

1545
02:51:58,857 --> 02:52:02,027
<i>Farewell, Frodo Baggins.</i>

1546
02:52:02,194 --> 02:52:05,656
I give you the light of Eärendil...

1547
02:52:06,365 --> 02:52:08,700
...our most beloved star.

1548
02:52:17,876 --> 02:52:22,256
<i>May it be a light for you
in dark places...</i>

1549
02:52:22,506 --> 02:52:26,593
<i>...when all other lights go out.</i>

1550
02:52:35,394 --> 02:52:38,564
I have taken my worst wound
at this parting...

1551
02:52:39,231 --> 02:52:43,527
...having looked my last upon that
which is fairest.

1552
02:52:44,236 --> 02:52:47,573
Henceforth I will call nothing fair
unless it be her gift to me.

1553
02:52:47,864 --> 02:52:49,783
What was her gift?

1554
02:52:49,992 --> 02:52:54,913
I asked her for one hair
from her golden head.

1555
02:52:55,706 --> 02:52:58,584
She gave me three.

1556
02:54:40,727 --> 02:54:44,189
Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.

1557
02:54:47,901 --> 02:54:51,029
I had hoped we would lose him
on the river.

1558
02:54:51,238 --> 02:54:54,408
But he's too clever a waterman.

1559
02:54:55,242 --> 02:54:58,537
And if he alerts the enemy
to our whereabouts...

1560
02:54:58,704 --> 02:55:00,997
...it will make the crossing
even more dangerous.

1561
02:55:01,164 --> 02:55:03,208
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

1562
02:55:03,375 --> 02:55:06,503
- No, Sam.
- You haven't eaten anything all day.

1563
02:55:06,670 --> 02:55:09,756
You're not sleeping, neither.
Don't think I haven't noticed.

1564
02:55:10,716 --> 02:55:13,719
- Mr. Frodo--
- I'm all right.

1565
02:55:13,885 --> 02:55:15,053
But you're not.

1566
02:55:15,345 --> 02:55:17,848
I'm here to help you.

1567
02:55:18,014 --> 02:55:19,725
I promised Gandalf that I would.

1568
02:55:25,689 --> 02:55:28,400
You can't help me, Sam.

1569
02:55:30,569 --> 02:55:32,279
Not this time.

1570
02:55:35,198 --> 02:55:37,284
Get some sleep.

1571
02:55:43,623 --> 02:55:45,751
Minas Tirith is the safer road.

1572
02:55:46,251 --> 02:55:49,045
You know that.
From there we can regroup.

1573
02:55:49,713 --> 02:55:51,923
Strike out for Mordor from a place
of strength.

1574
02:55:52,257 --> 02:55:55,177
There is no strength in Gondor
that can avail us.

1575
02:55:55,594 --> 02:55:57,596
You were quick enough to trust
the Elves.

1576
02:55:59,473 --> 02:56:02,309
Have you so little faith
in your own people?

1577
02:56:02,476 --> 02:56:05,479
Yes, there is weakness.
There is frailty.

1578
02:56:05,687 --> 02:56:08,982
But there is courage also,
and honor to be found in Men.

1579
02:56:09,232 --> 02:56:11,443
But you will not see that.

1580
02:56:11,777 --> 02:56:13,195
You are afraid!

1581
02:56:13,445 --> 02:56:15,989
All your life, you have hidden
in the shadows.

1582
02:56:16,281 --> 02:56:19,743
Scared of who you are,
of what you are.

1583
02:56:22,120 --> 02:56:26,500
I will not lead the Ring within
a hundred leagues of your city.

1584
02:56:38,345 --> 02:56:39,721
Frodo.

1585
02:56:41,598 --> 02:56:43,099
The Argonath.

1586
02:56:46,520 --> 02:56:50,273
Long have I desired
to look upon the kings of old.

1587
02:56:50,982 --> 02:56:52,943
My kin.

1588
02:58:11,897 --> 02:58:14,107
We cross the lake at nightfall.

1589
02:58:14,357 --> 02:58:16,902
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

1590
02:58:17,110 --> 02:58:20,572
- We approach Mordor from the North.
- Oh, yes?

1591
02:58:21,031 --> 02:58:24,868
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil...

1592
02:58:25,035 --> 02:58:28,246
...an impassable labyrinth
of razor-sharp rocks.

1593
02:58:28,455 --> 02:58:31,583
And after that, it gets even better.

1594
02:58:31,958 --> 02:58:36,922
Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.

1595
02:58:37,088 --> 02:58:38,465
That is our road.

1596
02:58:40,050 --> 02:58:43,261
I suggest you take some rest
and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

1597
02:58:43,470 --> 02:58:45,221
Recover my--

1598
02:58:48,224 --> 02:58:50,226
- We should leave now.
- No.

1599
02:58:50,393 --> 02:58:54,856
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

1600
02:58:55,065 --> 02:58:58,485
It is not the eastern shore
that worries me.

1601
02:58:58,735 --> 02:59:02,739
A shadow and a threat
has been growing in my mind.

1602
02:59:03,239 --> 02:59:07,410
Something draws near.
I can feel it.

1603
02:59:09,412 --> 02:59:14,376
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit.

1604
02:59:14,876 --> 02:59:16,586
Where's Frodo?

1605
02:59:42,195 --> 02:59:44,114
None of us should wander alone.

1606
02:59:45,490 --> 02:59:47,617
You, least of all.

1607
02:59:47,826 --> 02:59:50,286
So much depends on you.

1608
02:59:51,329 --> 02:59:53,289
Frodo?

1609
03:00:00,422 --> 03:00:02,966
I know why you seek solitude.

1610
03:00:03,675 --> 03:00:07,137
You suffer. I see it day by day.

1611
03:00:07,929 --> 03:00:10,974
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

1612
03:00:12,517 --> 03:00:15,186
There are other ways, Frodo.

1613
03:00:15,437 --> 03:00:19,232
- Other paths that we might take.
- I know what you would say.

1614
03:00:19,482 --> 03:00:23,236
It would seem like wisdom
but for the warning in my heart.

1615
03:00:23,486 --> 03:00:26,531
Warning? Against what?

1616
03:00:26,740 --> 03:00:28,867
We're all afraid, Frodo.

1617
03:00:29,075 --> 03:00:32,704
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

1618
03:00:32,954 --> 03:00:36,708
- ...don't you see that is madness?
- There is no other way.

1619
03:00:38,501 --> 03:00:41,838
I ask only for the strength
to defend my people!

1620
03:00:43,381 --> 03:00:45,467
- If you would but lend me the Ring.
- No.

1621
03:00:46,676 --> 03:00:50,346
- Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
- You are not yourself.

1622
03:00:52,182 --> 03:00:55,518
What chance do you think you have?

1623
03:00:55,685 --> 03:01:00,356
They will find you.
They will take the Ring.

1624
03:01:00,565 --> 03:01:04,277
And you will beg for death
before the end!

1625
03:01:06,404 --> 03:01:08,531
You fool!

1626
03:01:08,698 --> 03:01:12,702
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.

1627
03:01:12,869 --> 03:01:15,705
It should be mine! Give it to me!

1628
03:01:15,872 --> 03:01:17,207
- Give it to me!
- No!

1629
03:01:17,373 --> 03:01:19,209
- Give it to me!
- No.

1630
03:01:26,883 --> 03:01:28,885
I see your mind.

1631
03:01:29,094 --> 03:01:32,055
You will take the Ring to Sauron!

1632
03:01:32,263 --> 03:01:34,140
You will betray us!

1633
03:01:34,390 --> 03:01:37,560
You'll go to your death,
and the death of us all!

1634
03:01:38,019 --> 03:01:41,648
Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!

1635
03:01:48,738 --> 03:01:50,240
Frodo?

1636
03:01:54,577 --> 03:01:56,121
Frodo.

1637
03:02:00,083 --> 03:02:02,085
What have I done?

1638
03:02:02,293 --> 03:02:04,045
Please, Frodo.

1639
03:02:04,254 --> 03:02:06,923
Frodo, I'm sorry!

1640
03:02:07,132 --> 03:02:08,967
Frodo!

1641
03:02:55,471 --> 03:02:56,890
Frodo?

1642
03:02:58,141 --> 03:03:01,227
- It has taken Boromir.
- Where is the Ring?

1643
03:03:01,477 --> 03:03:03,229
Stay away!

1644
03:03:03,646 --> 03:03:05,231
Frodo!

1645
03:03:07,483 --> 03:03:11,321
- I swore to protect you.
- Can you protect me from yourself?

1646
03:03:20,997 --> 03:03:23,499
Would you destroy it?

1647
03:03:28,504 --> 03:03:30,423
<i>Aragorn.</i>

1648
03:03:33,843 --> 03:03:36,179
<i>Aragorn.</i>

1649
03:03:38,014 --> 03:03:39,849
<i>Elessar.</i>

1650
03:03:47,523 --> 03:03:50,860
I would have gone with you to the end.

1651
03:03:51,527 --> 03:03:54,364
Into the very fires of Mordor.

1652
03:03:57,700 --> 03:03:58,868
I know.

1653
03:04:01,371 --> 03:04:06,793
Look after the others. Especially Sam.
He will not understand.

1654
03:04:10,546 --> 03:04:12,257
Go, Frodo!

1655
03:04:15,260 --> 03:04:16,761
Run.

1656
03:04:17,053 --> 03:04:18,721
Run!

1657
03:04:43,246 --> 03:04:44,914
Mr. Frodo!

1658
03:04:54,215 --> 03:04:55,967
Find the halfling!

1659
03:04:57,593 --> 03:05:00,138
Find the halfling!

1660
03:05:03,599 --> 03:05:05,268
Elendil!

1661
03:05:11,774 --> 03:05:13,318
Aragorn, go!

1662
03:05:35,048 --> 03:05:36,341
Frodo!

1663
03:05:36,966 --> 03:05:38,551
Hide here. Quick!

1664
03:05:39,177 --> 03:05:40,636
Come on!

1665
03:05:43,139 --> 03:05:45,141
What's he doing?

1666
03:05:49,354 --> 03:05:51,356
He's leaving.

1667
03:05:56,152 --> 03:05:59,072
- No!
- Pippin!

1668
03:06:03,993 --> 03:06:06,329
Run, Frodo. Go on!

1669
03:06:06,871 --> 03:06:09,999
- Hey! Hey, you!
- Over here!

1670
03:06:10,375 --> 03:06:12,001
- Over here!
- This way!

1671
03:06:22,845 --> 03:06:25,181
- It's working!
- I know it's working! Run!

1672
03:07:20,570 --> 03:07:23,614
- The horn of Gondor.
- Boromir.

1673
03:08:06,699 --> 03:08:07,825
Run!

1674
03:11:39,412 --> 03:11:41,038
No.

1675
03:11:44,875 --> 03:11:47,920
- They took the little ones.
- Hold still.

1676
03:11:48,212 --> 03:11:50,339
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

1677
03:11:52,216 --> 03:11:53,634
I let Frodo go.

1678
03:11:54,343 --> 03:11:56,887
Then you did what I could not.

1679
03:11:57,888 --> 03:12:01,225
I tried to take the Ring from him.

1680
03:12:01,726 --> 03:12:06,063
- The Ring is beyond our reach now.
- Forgive me.

1681
03:12:06,230 --> 03:12:08,566
I did not see it.

1682
03:12:08,733 --> 03:12:11,902
- I have failed you all.
- No, Boromir.

1683
03:12:12,403 --> 03:12:14,905
You fought bravely.

1684
03:12:15,239 --> 03:12:17,908
You have kept your honor.

1685
03:12:18,451 --> 03:12:20,411
Leave it.

1686
03:12:20,745 --> 03:12:22,747
It is over.

1687
03:12:23,956 --> 03:12:29,253
The world of Men will fall.
And all will come to darkness...

1688
03:12:29,670 --> 03:12:32,673
...and my city to ruin.

1689
03:12:36,761 --> 03:12:39,430
I do not know what strength
is in my blood...

1690
03:12:39,597 --> 03:12:43,601
...but I swear to you,
I will not let the White City fall...

1691
03:12:44,602 --> 03:12:47,104
...nor our people fail.

1692
03:12:48,105 --> 03:12:49,440
Our people.

1693
03:12:53,277 --> 03:12:55,446
Our people.

1694
03:13:17,134 --> 03:13:20,137
I would have followed you, my brother.

1695
03:13:21,722 --> 03:13:23,724
My captain.

1696
03:13:26,310 --> 03:13:28,312
My king.

1697
03:13:47,957 --> 03:13:50,167
Be at peace...

1698
03:13:50,501 --> 03:13:52,503
...son of Gondor.

1699
03:14:09,019 --> 03:14:12,356
They will look for his coming
from the White Tower.

1700
03:14:12,857 --> 03:14:15,860
But he will not return.

1701
03:14:39,049 --> 03:14:41,051
Frodo!

1702
03:15:00,571 --> 03:15:03,824
<i>I wish the Ring had never come to me.</i>

1703
03:15:05,075 --> 03:15:08,078
<i>I wish none of this had happened.</i>

1704
03:15:11,081 --> 03:15:13,834
<i>So do all who live
to see such times...</i>

1705
03:15:14,043 --> 03:15:17,463
<i>...but that is not for them to decide.</i>

1706
03:15:17,630 --> 03:15:20,257
<i>All you have to decide...</i>

1707
03:15:20,549 --> 03:15:25,262
...is what to do with the time
that is given to you.

1708
03:15:54,124 --> 03:15:56,126
Frodo, no!

1709
03:15:56,669 --> 03:15:57,962
Frodo!

1710
03:15:58,796 --> 03:16:01,465
- Mr. Frodo!
- No, Sam.

1711
03:16:04,969 --> 03:16:06,971
Go back, Sam!

1712
03:16:07,471 --> 03:16:11,100
- I'm going to Mordor alone.
- Of course you are.

1713
03:16:11,308 --> 03:16:14,144
And I'm coming with you!

1714
03:16:14,603 --> 03:16:16,981
You can't swim!

1715
03:16:20,818 --> 03:16:22,486
Sam!

1716
03:16:28,117 --> 03:16:29,410
Sam!

1717
03:17:10,367 --> 03:17:13,037
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

1718
03:17:13,370 --> 03:17:17,708
A promise:
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."

1719
03:17:18,876 --> 03:17:21,462
And I don't mean to.

1720
03:17:21,712 --> 03:17:23,881
I don't mean to.

1721
03:17:25,549 --> 03:17:27,384
Sam.

1722
03:17:42,232 --> 03:17:43,901
Come on.

1723
03:18:12,429 --> 03:18:16,934
Hurry! Frodo and Sam
have reached the eastern shore.

1724
03:18:31,782 --> 03:18:36,787
- You mean not to follow them.
- Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

1725
03:18:40,290 --> 03:18:45,129
Then it has all been in vain.
The Fellowship has failed.

1726
03:18:56,974 --> 03:19:00,144
Not if we hold true to each other.

1727
03:19:01,478 --> 03:19:05,983
We will not abandon Merry and Pippin
to torment and death.

1728
03:19:06,984 --> 03:19:12,281
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

1729
03:19:13,490 --> 03:19:15,576
We travel light.

1730
03:19:15,784 --> 03:19:17,661
Let us hunt some Orc.

1731
03:19:20,664 --> 03:19:22,666
Yes!

1732
03:19:41,685 --> 03:19:43,103
Mordor.

1733
03:19:43,687 --> 03:19:47,107
I hope the others find a safer road.

1734
03:19:48,025 --> 03:19:50,611
Strider will look after them.

1735
03:19:51,528 --> 03:19:54,865
I don't suppose
we'll ever see them again.

1736
03:19:55,199 --> 03:19:57,701
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

1737
03:19:57,868 --> 03:19:59,411
We may.

1738
03:20:01,538 --> 03:20:02,539
Sam...

1739
03:20:06,210 --> 03:20:08,837
...I'm glad you are with me.
