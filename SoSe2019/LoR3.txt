1
00:01:17,287 --> 00:01:18,913
Sméagol!

2
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,415
I've got one!

3
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:23,960
I've got a fish, Sméag. Sméagol!

4
00:01:24,127 --> 00:01:27,255
Pull it in. Go on. Go on. Go on.
Pull it in.

5
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:37,307
Déagol!

6
00:02:34,697 --> 00:02:36,532
Déagol?

7
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,329
Déagol.

8
00:02:57,136 --> 00:02:59,222
Give us that, Déagol, my love.

9
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:05,478
Why?

10
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:08,815
Because...

11
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:12,735
...it's my birthday and I wants it.

12
00:04:46,788 --> 00:04:52,043
My precious.

13
00:04:59,592 --> 00:05:02,512
<i>They cursed us.</i>

14
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:04,055
<i>Murderer.</i>

15
00:05:04,222 --> 00:05:06,682
<i>"Murderer" they called us.</i>

16
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:11,646
<i>They cursed us
and drove us away.</i>

17
00:05:12,772 --> 00:05:14,482
Gollum.

18
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:16,359
Gollum.

19
00:05:16,526 --> 00:05:18,361
Gollum.

20
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:25,034
<i>And we wept, precious.</i>

21
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:28,788
<i>We wept to be so alone.</i>

22
00:05:31,374 --> 00:05:35,169
<i>--and cool
So nice for feet</i>

23
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:40,550
<i>And we only wish
To catch a fish</i>

24
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:43,970
<i>So juicy sweet</i>

25
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:53,855
<i>And we forgot the taste of bread...</i>

26
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:57,650
<i>...the sound of trees...</i>

27
00:05:58,526 --> 00:06:01,737
<i>...the softness of the wind.</i>

28
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:08,035
<i>We even forgot our own name.</i>

29
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:22,592
<i>My precious.</i>

30
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:09,096
Wake up!

31
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,807
Wake up!

32
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:13,768
Wake up, sleepies.

33
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:15,811
We must go, yes.

34
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:18,648
We must go at once.

35
00:07:22,193 --> 00:07:25,279
Haven't you had any sleep, Mr. Frodo?

36
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,034
I've gone and had too much.

37
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,162
Must be getting late.

38
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:34,830
No.

39
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:36,916
It isn't.

40
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:40,127
It isn't midday yet.

41
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:42,380
The days are growing darker.

42
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,345
Come on!

43
00:07:51,764 --> 00:07:54,016
Must go! No time!

44
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:56,560
Not before Mr. Frodo's
had something to eat.

45
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:59,605
No time to lose, silly.

46
00:08:08,364 --> 00:08:09,657
Here.

47
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:14,704
What about you?

48
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,249
Oh, no, I'm not hungry.
Leastways, not for lembas bread.

49
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,209
Sam.

50
00:08:22,795 --> 00:08:24,338
All right.

51
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:27,008
We don't have that much left.

52
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:30,052
We have to be careful
or we're going to run out.

53
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:35,141
You go ahead and eat that, Mr. Frodo.

54
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:36,726
I've rationed it.

55
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:38,894
There should be enough.

56
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:42,273
For what?

57
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:45,693
The journey home.

58
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:55,870
Come, Hobbitses.

59
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:59,123
Very close now.

60
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:02,543
Very close to Mordor.

61
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,379
No safe places here.

62
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:07,715
Hurry.

63
00:10:00,101 --> 00:10:01,811
It's good.

64
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:04,480
Definitely from the Shire.

65
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,818
Longbottom Leaf.

66
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:18,494
I feel like I'm back at
The Green Dragon.

67
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:22,832
- Mmm. Green Dragon.
- A mug of ale in my hand.

68
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:27,586
Putting my feet up on a settle
after a hard day's work.

69
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,632
Only, you've never done
a hard day's work.

70
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:47,481
Welcome, my lords...

71
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:49,900
...to Isengard!

72
00:10:50,276 --> 00:10:54,029
You young rascals!
A merry hunt you've led us on...

73
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:59,201
...and now we find you feasting
and...and smoking!

74
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:02,580
We are sitting on a field of victory...

75
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:06,208
...enjoying a few well-earned comforts.

76
00:11:07,293 --> 00:11:11,130
The salted pork is particularly good.

77
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:14,049
Salted pork?

78
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:18,679
- Huh. Hobbits.
- We're under orders from Treebeard...

79
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:21,682
...who's taken over management
of Isengard.

80
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:27,229
Young Master Gandalf.

81
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:31,984
I'm glad you've come.

82
00:11:32,151 --> 00:11:36,572
Wood and water, stock and stone
I can master.

83
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:40,409
But there is a wizard to manage here...

84
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:42,578
...locked in his tower.

85
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:46,582
Show yourself.

86
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:48,542
Be careful.

87
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:51,962
Even in defeat, Saruman is dangerous.

88
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:54,215
Well, let's just have his head
and be done with it.

89
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,467
No.

90
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,136
We need him alive.

91
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:02,681
We need him to talk.

92
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:08,812
You have fought many wars
and slain many men, Théoden King...

93
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:10,481
...and made peace afterwards.

94
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:15,569
Can we not take counsel together
as we once did, my old friend?

95
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:18,989
Can we not have peace, you and I?

96
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:21,033
We shall have peace.

97
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:25,079
We shall have peace...

98
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:29,333
...when you answer
for the burning of the Westfold...

99
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,211
...and the children that lie dead there!

100
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:37,174
We shall have peace
when the lives of the soldiers...

101
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:39,385
...whose bodies were hewn
even as they lay dead...

102
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:43,097
...against the gates of the Hornburg,
are avenged!

103
00:12:44,682 --> 00:12:50,229
When you hang from a gibbet
for the sport of your own crows...

104
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:53,399
...we shall have peace.

105
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:58,862
Gibbets and crows?

106
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:00,447
Dotard!

107
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:04,743
What do you want, Gandalf Greyhame?

108
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:08,247
Let me guess. The Key of Orthanc.

109
00:13:08,414 --> 00:13:11,375
Or perhaps the Keys of Barad-dûr itself...

110
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:15,546
...along with the crowns of the seven kings
and the rods of the Five Wizards!

111
00:13:15,713 --> 00:13:18,632
Your treachery has already cost
many lives.

112
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:21,218
Thousands more are now at risk.

113
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:23,721
But you could save them, Saruman.

114
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:26,223
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

115
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,643
So you have come here for information.

116
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:32,396
I have some for you.

117
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,779
Something festers
in the heart of Middle-earth.

118
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:43,240
Something that you have failed to see.

119
00:13:45,743 --> 00:13:49,246
But the Great Eye has seen it.

120
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:53,959
Even now he presses his advantage.

121
00:13:55,753 --> 00:13:59,089
His attack will come soon.

122
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:03,427
You're all going to die.

123
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:09,141
But you know this, don't you, Gandalf?

124
00:14:09,308 --> 00:14:13,937
You cannot think that this Ranger
will ever sit upon the throne of Gondor.

125
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:20,194
This exile, crept from the shadows,
will never be crowned king.

126
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:25,199
Gandalf does not hesitate
to sacrifice those closest to him...

127
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:28,327
...those he professes to love.

128
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:33,957
Tell me, what words of comfort
did you give the Halfling...

129
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:36,502
...before you sent him to his doom?

130
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:44,301
The path that you have set him on
can only lead to death.

131
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:46,804
I've heard enough!

132
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,806
Shoot him.
Stick an arrow in his gob.

133
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:50,974
No.

134
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:53,644
Come down, Saruman...

135
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:57,731
- ...and your life will be spared.
- Save your pity and your mercy.

136
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,233
I have no use for it!

137
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:09,993
Saruman...

138
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:12,996
...your staff is broken.

139
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:28,512
Gríma, you need not follow him.

140
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,349
You were not always as you are now.

141
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:35,352
You were once a Man of Rohan.

142
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,728
Come down.

143
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:39,606
A Man of Rohan?

144
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:42,776
What is the house of Rohan...

145
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:46,613
...but a thatched barn
where brigands drink in the reek...

146
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:50,534
...and their brats roll on the floor
with the dogs?

147
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:57,499
The victory at Helm's Deep does not
belong to you, Théoden Horse-master.

148
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:02,713
You are a lesser son of greater sires.

149
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,717
Gríma...

150
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:09,428
...come down.

151
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:11,221
Be free of him.

152
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:15,392
- Free? He will never be free.
- No.

153
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:18,395
Get down, cur!

154
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:21,398
Saruman!

155
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:24,234
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

156
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:26,904
Tell us what you know!

157
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:33,619
You withdraw your guard, and I will tell you
where your doom will be decided.

158
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:36,747
I will not be held prisoner here.

159
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:06,068
Send word to all our allies...

160
00:17:06,235 --> 00:17:09,112
...and to every corner of Middle-earth
that still stands free.

161
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:12,783
The enemy moves against us.
We need to know where he will strike.

162
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:35,889
The filth of Saruman...

163
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:39,893
...is washing away.

164
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:44,648
Trees will come back to live here.

165
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:47,317
Young trees.

166
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:49,653
- Wild trees.
- Pippin!

167
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:01,331
Bless my bark!

168
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:03,333
Peregrin Took!

169
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,169
I'll take that, my lad.

170
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:08,171
Quickly, now.

171
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:03,935
Tonight we remember those
who gave their blood to defend this country.

172
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:06,647
Hail the victorious dead.

173
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,231
Hail!

174
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:21,119
No pauses.

175
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:25,457
- No spills.
- And no regurgitation.

176
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:27,626
So it's a drinking game?

177
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:31,797
Last one standing wins.

178
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:38,303
What'll we drink to? Let's drink to victory!

179
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,805
To victory!

180
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:25,475
I am happy for you.

181
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:28,270
He is an honorable man.

182
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:31,148
You are both honorable men.

183
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:38,321
It was not Théoden of Rohan
who led our people to victory.

184
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:48,331
Ah, don't listen to me.

185
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,667
You are young.

186
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:53,170
And tonight is for you.

187
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:09,186
Here, here.

188
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:16,568
It's the Dwarves that go swimming
with little, hairy women.

189
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:23,200
I feel something.

190
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:27,871
A slight tingle in my fingers.

191
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:30,123
I think it's affecting me.

192
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:33,752
What did I say?

193
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,255
He can't hold his liquor.

194
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:45,931
Game over.

195
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:48,475
<i>Oh, you can search far and wide</i>

196
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:50,101
<i>You can drink the whole town dry</i>

197
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:53,647
<i>But you'll never find a beer so brown
But you'll never find a beer so brown</i>

198
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:58,235
<i>As the one we drink in our hometown
As the one we drink in our hometown</i>

199
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:02,280
<i>You can drink your fancy ales
You can drink 'em by the flagon</i>

200
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:05,617
<i>But the only brew for the brave and true</i>

201
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:09,579
Pippin!

202
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:13,083
<i>But the only brew for the brave and true</i>

203
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,460
<i>Comes from The Green Dragon</i>

204
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:21,633
Thank you! I win!

205
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:25,929
No news of Frodo?

206
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:29,599
No word. Nothing.

207
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:32,602
We have time.

208
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:37,399
Every day, Frodo moves closer to Mordor.

209
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:40,193
Do we know that?

210
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,782
What does your heart tell you?

211
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:56,126
That Frodo is alive.

212
00:22:58,295 --> 00:23:00,130
Yes.

213
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:04,676
Yes, he's alive.

214
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:09,973
Too risky. Too risky.

215
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,349
Thieves.

216
00:23:11,516 --> 00:23:13,560
They stole it from us.

217
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:16,813
Kill them. Kill them. Kill them both.

218
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:22,152
Shh! Quiet! Mustn't wake them.

219
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:24,821
Mustn't ruin it now.

220
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:27,073
But they knows.

221
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,159
They knows.

222
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:31,953
They suspects us.

223
00:23:33,163 --> 00:23:36,666
What's it saying, my precious, my love?

224
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:40,462
Is Sméagol losing his nerve?

225
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:43,506
No. Not.

226
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:47,886
Never. Sméagol hates nasty Hobbitses.

227
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:52,891
Sméagol wants to see them dead.

228
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:55,602
And we will.

229
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:59,856
Sméagol did it once.
He can do it again.

230
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:05,862
It's ours!

231
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:08,698
Ours!

232
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:12,702
We must get the precious.
We must get it back.

233
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:16,247
Patience! Patience, my love.

234
00:24:16,414 --> 00:24:20,794
First we must lead them to her.

235
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:26,716
We lead them to the Winding Stair.

236
00:24:26,883 --> 00:24:29,552
Yes, the stairs. And then?

237
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:32,722
Up, up, up, up,
up the stairs we go...

238
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:39,270
...until we come to the tunnel.

239
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:42,774
And when they go in...

240
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:45,735
...there's no coming out.

241
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:49,572
She's always hungry.

242
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:54,494
She always needs to feed.

243
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:56,079
She must eat.

244
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:58,415
All she gets is filthy Orcses.

245
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:01,292
And they doesn't taste very nice,
does they, precious?

246
00:25:01,918 --> 00:25:03,586
No.

247
00:25:03,753 --> 00:25:08,425
Not very nice at all, my love.

248
00:25:08,591 --> 00:25:11,428
She hungers for sweeter meats.

249
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:13,430
Hobbit meat.

250
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:18,435
And when she throws away the bones
and the empty clothes...

251
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:21,646
...then we will find it.

252
00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:26,151
And take it for me!

253
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:29,320
For us.

254
00:25:29,821 --> 00:25:32,824
Yes. We meant "for us."

255
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:36,453
Gollum. Gollum.

256
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:41,124
The precious will be ours...

257
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:45,795
...once the Hobbitses are dead!

258
00:25:46,296 --> 00:25:47,797
You treacherous little toad!

259
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:52,802
No! No! Master!

260
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:54,596
No, Sam! Leave him alone!

261
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:58,141
I heard it from his own mouth.
He means to murder us.

262
00:25:58,308 --> 00:26:02,479
Never! Sméagol wouldn't hurt a fly.

263
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:06,524
He's a horrid, fat Hobbit...

264
00:26:06,691 --> 00:26:08,318
...who hates Sméagol...

265
00:26:08,485 --> 00:26:11,237
...and who makes up nasty lies.

266
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:14,115
You miserable little maggot!
I'll stove your head in!

267
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:15,742
Sam!

268
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,702
Call me a liar? You're a liar!

269
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:23,333
- You scare him off, we're lost!
- I don't care! I can't do it, Mr. Frodo.

270
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,669
- I won't wait around for him to kill us!
- I'm not sending him away.

271
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:28,338
You don't see it, do you?

272
00:26:28,713 --> 00:26:30,173
He's a villain.

273
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:34,761
We can't do this by ourselves, Sam.
Not without a guide.

274
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:38,515
I need you on my side.

275
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:41,643
I'm on your side, Mr. Frodo.

276
00:26:43,144 --> 00:26:46,064
I know, Sam. I know.

277
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:48,608
Trust me.

278
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:51,194
Come, Sméagol.

279
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:00,597
What time is it?

280
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:04,434
Not yet dawn.

281
00:28:11,316 --> 00:28:14,360
I dreamed I saw a great wave...

282
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:18,531
...climbing over green lands
and above the hills.

283
00:28:19,782 --> 00:28:22,285
I stood upon the brink.

284
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:26,331
It was utterly dark in the abyss
before my feet.

285
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:31,044
A light shone behind me...

286
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:34,130
...but I could not turn.

287
00:28:34,297 --> 00:28:37,675
I could only stand there, waiting.

288
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:41,846
Night changes many thoughts.

289
00:28:42,263 --> 00:28:44,390
Sleep, Éowyn.

290
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:47,185
Sleep...

291
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:51,814
...while you can.

292
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:18,216
The stars are veiled.

293
00:29:19,217 --> 00:29:22,720
Something stirs in the east.

294
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:26,516
A sleepless malice.

295
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:31,396
The Eye of the enemy is moving.

296
00:29:44,826 --> 00:29:47,537
What are you doing?

297
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:53,626
Pippin!

298
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:02,885
Pippin?

299
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:17,066
Pippin.

300
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:20,403
- What, are you mad?
- I just want to look at it.

301
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:21,654
Just one more time.

302
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:23,990
Put it back.

303
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,085
Pippin.

304
00:30:42,592 --> 00:30:44,093
No!

305
00:30:49,223 --> 00:30:50,516
Pippin.

306
00:30:53,811 --> 00:30:55,021
He is here.

307
00:30:55,188 --> 00:30:57,482
<i>I see you.</i>

308
00:31:00,485 --> 00:31:02,111
Pippin!

309
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:19,504
Help! Gandalf, help!

310
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:23,132
Someone help him!

311
00:31:29,514 --> 00:31:30,723
Pippin!

312
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:33,101
Fool of a Took!

313
00:31:54,205 --> 00:31:56,416
Look at me.

314
00:31:58,376 --> 00:32:02,505
Gandalf, forgive me.

315
00:32:02,672 --> 00:32:04,549
Look at me.

316
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:06,551
What did you see?

317
00:32:10,054 --> 00:32:12,140
A tree.

318
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:14,976
There was a white tree...

319
00:32:15,143 --> 00:32:16,644
...in a courtyard of stone.

320
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:20,731
It was dead.

321
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:26,737
The city was burning.

322
00:32:26,904 --> 00:32:30,283
Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?

323
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,994
I saw...

324
00:32:36,372 --> 00:32:37,748
I saw him.

325
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:43,004
I could hear his voice in my head.

326
00:32:43,171 --> 00:32:45,590
And what did you tell him?

327
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:47,592
Speak!

328
00:32:51,762 --> 00:32:54,932
He asked me my name.
I didn't answer.

329
00:32:55,099 --> 00:32:56,559
He hurt me.

330
00:32:56,726 --> 00:32:59,187
What did you tell him
about Frodo and the Ring?

331
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:05,151
There was no lie in Pippin's eyes.

332
00:33:05,985 --> 00:33:08,237
A fool...

333
00:33:08,404 --> 00:33:10,698
...but an honest fool he remains.

334
00:33:11,157 --> 00:33:14,702
He told Sauron nothing
of Frodo and the Ring.

335
00:33:15,745 --> 00:33:18,122
We've been strangely fortunate.

336
00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:22,168
Pippin saw in the palantír
a glimpse of the enemy's plan.

337
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:27,048
Sauron moves to strike
the city of Minas Tirith.

338
00:33:27,632 --> 00:33:31,385
His defeat at Helm's Deep
showed our enemy one thing.

339
00:33:31,552 --> 00:33:33,888
He knows the heir of Elendil
has come forth.

340
00:33:34,055 --> 00:33:36,182
Men are not as weak as he supposed.

341
00:33:36,349 --> 00:33:40,144
There is courage still, strength
enough perhaps to challenge him.

342
00:33:40,353 --> 00:33:42,230
Sauron fears this.

343
00:33:42,396 --> 00:33:46,734
He will not risk the peoples of
Middle-earth uniting under one banner.

344
00:33:47,902 --> 00:33:50,321
He will raze Minas Tirith
to the ground...

345
00:33:50,488 --> 00:33:53,991
...before he sees a king
return to the throne of Men.

346
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:58,079
If the beacons of Gondor are lit,
Rohan must be ready for war.

347
00:33:58,996 --> 00:34:01,207
Tell me...

348
00:34:01,374 --> 00:34:05,169
...why should we ride to the aid
of those who did not come to ours?

349
00:34:09,048 --> 00:34:10,883
What do we owe Gondor?

350
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:14,053
- I will go.
- No!

351
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:17,390
- They must be warned.
- They will be.

352
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:23,354
You must come to Minas Tirith
by another road.

353
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:28,359
Follow the river.
Look to the black ships.

354
00:34:29,318 --> 00:34:31,279
Understand this:

355
00:34:31,445 --> 00:34:35,116
Things are now in motion
that cannot be undone.

356
00:34:36,617 --> 00:34:38,703
I ride for Minas Tirith...

357
00:34:40,955 --> 00:34:43,624
...and I won't be going alone.

358
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:49,046
Of all the inquisitive Hobbits,
Peregrin Took, you are the worst.

359
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:51,716
Hurry! Hurry!

360
00:34:53,217 --> 00:34:54,635
Where are we going?

361
00:34:54,802 --> 00:34:56,053
Why did you look?

362
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,973
Why do you always have to look?

363
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,226
- I don't know. I can't help it.
- You never can.

364
00:35:02,685 --> 00:35:04,103
I'm sorry, all right?

365
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:09,108
- I won't do it again.
- Don't you understand?

366
00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:11,819
The enemy thinks you have the Ring.

367
00:35:11,986 --> 00:35:15,740
He's going to be looking for you, Pip.
They have to get you out of here.

368
00:35:17,158 --> 00:35:19,827
And you--? You're coming with me?

369
00:35:22,038 --> 00:35:23,456
Merry?

370
00:35:23,623 --> 00:35:24,915
Come on.

371
00:35:30,421 --> 00:35:31,797
How far is Minas Tirith?

372
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:34,592
Three days' ride, as the Nazgûl flies.

373
00:35:34,759 --> 00:35:38,262
And you better hope we don't have
one of those on our tail.

374
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:40,473
Here.

375
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,433
Something for the road.

376
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:45,269
The last of the Longbottom Leaf.

377
00:35:45,436 --> 00:35:49,440
I know you've run out.
You smoke too much, Pippin.

378
00:35:49,607 --> 00:35:52,109
But-- But we'll see each other soon.

379
00:35:55,446 --> 00:35:57,948
- Won't we?
- I don't know.

380
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:01,994
I don't know what's going to happen.

381
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:03,871
- Merry.
- Run, Shadowfax.

382
00:36:04,038 --> 00:36:05,498
Show us the meaning of haste.

383
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:07,583
Merry!

384
00:36:18,052 --> 00:36:19,178
Merry!

385
00:36:29,647 --> 00:36:31,148
He's always followed me...

386
00:36:31,816 --> 00:36:33,859
...everywhere I went...

387
00:36:34,193 --> 00:36:35,986
...since before we were tweens.

388
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:41,075
I would get him into
the worst sort of trouble...

389
00:36:41,242 --> 00:36:43,327
...but I was always there to get him out.

390
00:36:45,788 --> 00:36:47,665
Now he's gone.

391
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:52,253
Just like Frodo and Sam.

392
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:55,631
One thing I have learned about Hobbits:

393
00:36:55,798 --> 00:36:57,466
They're a most hardy folk.

394
00:36:58,008 --> 00:37:01,721
Foolhardy, maybe. He's a Took.

395
00:37:16,193 --> 00:37:18,487
<i>Take her by the safest road.</i>

396
00:37:18,654 --> 00:37:21,157
<i>A ship lies anchored
in the Grey Havens.</i>

397
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:25,202
<i>It waits to carry her across the sea.</i>

398
00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:28,748
<i>The last journey of Arwen Undómiel.</i>

399
00:38:34,355 --> 00:38:37,441
There is nothing for you here...

400
00:38:37,942 --> 00:38:40,152
...only death.

401
00:38:47,451 --> 00:38:48,744
Lady Arwen...

402
00:38:49,662 --> 00:38:51,580
...we cannot delay.

403
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:55,292
My lady!

404
00:39:14,687 --> 00:39:17,314
- Tell me what you have seen.
- Arwen.

405
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:19,441
You have the gift of foresight.

406
00:39:19,608 --> 00:39:21,402
What did you see?

407
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:25,364
I looked into your future,
and I saw death.

408
00:39:25,906 --> 00:39:28,033
But there is also life.

409
00:39:29,952 --> 00:39:33,998
You saw there was a child.
You saw my son.

410
00:39:34,623 --> 00:39:37,167
That future is almost gone.

411
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:39,336
But it is not lost.

412
00:39:41,922 --> 00:39:44,133
Nothing is certain.

413
00:39:45,843 --> 00:39:48,554
Some things are certain.

414
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:55,185
If I leave him now...

415
00:39:55,352 --> 00:39:57,980
...I will regret it forever.

416
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:01,400
It is time.

417
00:40:06,655 --> 00:40:10,451
<i>From the ashes a fire shall be woken</i>

418
00:40:10,618 --> 00:40:14,038
<i>A light from the shadow shall spring</i>

419
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:17,499
<i>Renewed shall be blade that was broken</i>

420
00:40:24,882 --> 00:40:28,093
<i>The crownless again shall be king</i>

421
00:40:31,847 --> 00:40:33,891
Re-forge the sword.

422
00:41:08,759 --> 00:41:11,470
Your hands are cold.

423
00:41:14,848 --> 00:41:17,977
The life of the Eldar is leaving you.

424
00:41:21,397 --> 00:41:23,315
This was my choice.

425
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:27,444
Whether by your will or not...

426
00:41:28,779 --> 00:41:33,075
...there is no ship now
that can bear me hence.

427
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:23,125
We've just passed
into the realm of Gondor.

428
00:42:34,762 --> 00:42:37,014
Minas Tirith.

429
00:42:37,598 --> 00:42:39,933
City of kings.

430
00:43:11,298 --> 00:43:13,092
Make way!

431
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:44,123
It's the tree.

432
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:45,958
Gandalf. Gandalf.

433
00:43:46,125 --> 00:43:48,377
Yes, the White Tree of Gondor.

434
00:43:48,544 --> 00:43:50,379
The tree of the king.

435
00:43:50,546 --> 00:43:53,215
Lord Denethor, however,
is not king.

436
00:43:53,382 --> 00:43:56,051
He is a steward only,
a caretaker of the throne.

437
00:43:56,802 --> 00:44:00,347
Now listen carefully.
Lord Denethor is Boromir's father.

438
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:04,685
To give him news of his beloved son's
death would be most unwise.

439
00:44:05,144 --> 00:44:08,605
And do not mention Frodo or the Ring.

440
00:44:09,481 --> 00:44:12,234
And say nothing of Aragorn either.

441
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:17,948
In fact, it's better if you
don't speak at all, Peregrin Took.

442
00:44:48,103 --> 00:44:54,610
Hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion,
lord and steward of Gondor.

443
00:45:00,115 --> 00:45:04,828
I come with tidings in this dark hour,
and with counsel.

444
00:45:05,787 --> 00:45:09,166
Perhaps you come to explain this.

445
00:45:14,796 --> 00:45:19,343
Perhaps you come to tell me
why my son is dead.

446
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:36,818
Boromir died to save us...

447
00:45:36,985 --> 00:45:38,654
...my kinsman and me.

448
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:42,324
- He fell defending us from many foes.
- Pippin.

449
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:51,291
I offer you my service, such as it is...

450
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:53,835
...in payment of this debt.

451
00:45:56,004 --> 00:45:59,341
This is my first command to you.

452
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:03,512
How did you escape
and my son did not...

453
00:46:03,845 --> 00:46:06,181
...so mighty a man as he was?

454
00:46:06,848 --> 00:46:10,185
The mightiest man
may be slain by one arrow...

455
00:46:10,435 --> 00:46:12,354
...and Boromir was pierced by many.

456
00:46:16,483 --> 00:46:18,193
Get up.

457
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:22,990
My lord, there will be a time
to grieve for Boromir...

458
00:46:23,448 --> 00:46:25,200
...but it is not now.

459
00:46:25,909 --> 00:46:28,120
War is coming.

460
00:46:28,453 --> 00:46:32,874
The enemy is on your doorstep.
As steward, you are charged...

461
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:37,212
...with the defense of this city.
Where are Gondor's armies?

462
00:46:37,379 --> 00:46:42,259
You still have friends.
You are not alone in this fight.

463
00:46:42,426 --> 00:46:46,930
Send word to Théoden of Rohan.
Light the beacons.

464
00:46:48,515 --> 00:46:52,060
You think you are wise, Mithrandir.

465
00:46:52,227 --> 00:46:55,272
Yet for all your subtleties,
you have not wisdom.

466
00:46:57,399 --> 00:47:01,570
Do you think the eyes
of the White Tower are blind?

467
00:47:01,737 --> 00:47:04,823
I have seen more than you know.

468
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:08,201
With your left hand you would use me
as a shield against Mordor.

469
00:47:08,368 --> 00:47:11,246
And with your right
you'd seek to supplant me.

470
00:47:11,413 --> 00:47:15,125
I know who rides with Théoden of Rohan.

471
00:47:15,292 --> 00:47:21,256
Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears
of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

472
00:47:21,423 --> 00:47:26,261
And I tell you now, I will not bow
to this Ranger from the North...

473
00:47:26,428 --> 00:47:30,932
...last of a ragged house
long bereft of lordship.

474
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:36,938
Authority is not given to you
to deny the return of the king, steward.

475
00:47:37,105 --> 00:47:41,526
The rule of Gondor is mine
and no other's.

476
00:47:46,698 --> 00:47:48,492
Come.

477
00:47:56,416 --> 00:47:59,002
All has turned to vain ambition.

478
00:47:59,169 --> 00:48:02,631
He would even use his grief
as a cloak.

479
00:48:05,509 --> 00:48:08,303
A thousand years
this city has stood.

480
00:48:09,388 --> 00:48:11,807
Now, at the whim of a madman,
it will fall.

481
00:48:13,016 --> 00:48:15,227
And the White Tree,
the tree of the king...

482
00:48:15,394 --> 00:48:16,937
...will never bloom again.

483
00:48:17,104 --> 00:48:18,814
Why are they still guarding it?

484
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:21,024
They guard it because they have hope.

485
00:48:21,191 --> 00:48:23,819
A faint and fading hope
that one day it will flower.

486
00:48:23,985 --> 00:48:28,740
That a king will come
and this city will be as it once was...

487
00:48:28,907 --> 00:48:31,827
...before it fell into decay.

488
00:48:31,993 --> 00:48:35,247
The old wisdom borne out
of the West was forsaken.

489
00:48:35,414 --> 00:48:39,709
Kings made tombs more splendid
than the houses of the living...

490
00:48:39,918 --> 00:48:41,837
...and counted the old names
of their descent...

491
00:48:42,003 --> 00:48:44,798
...dearer than the names of their sons.

492
00:48:44,965 --> 00:48:50,011
Childless lords sat in aged halls,
musing on heraldry...

493
00:48:50,178 --> 00:48:55,517
...or in high, cold towers,
asking questions of the stars.

494
00:48:55,684 --> 00:48:59,479
And so the people of Gondor
fell into ruin.

495
00:49:00,439 --> 00:49:02,774
The line of kings failed.

496
00:49:03,483 --> 00:49:05,861
The White Tree withered.

497
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:10,740
The rule of Gondor was given over
to lesser men.

498
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:22,711
Mordor.

499
00:49:23,211 --> 00:49:26,882
Yes, there it lies.

500
00:49:27,716 --> 00:49:31,052
This city has dwelt ever
in the sight of its shadow.

501
00:49:33,054 --> 00:49:34,723
A storm is coming.

502
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:38,310
This is not the weather of the world.

503
00:49:38,477 --> 00:49:40,687
This is a device of Sauron's making.

504
00:49:40,854 --> 00:49:44,608
A broil of fume
he sends ahead of his host.

505
00:49:45,192 --> 00:49:47,652
The Orcs of Mordor
have no love of daylight...

506
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:49,654
...so he covers the face of the sun...

507
00:49:49,821 --> 00:49:53,575
...to ease their passage
along the road to war.

508
00:49:53,742 --> 00:49:57,037
When the Shadow of Mordor
reaches this city...

509
00:49:57,746 --> 00:49:59,456
...it will begin.

510
00:50:01,124 --> 00:50:02,709
Well...

511
00:50:03,084 --> 00:50:04,419
...Minas Tirith...

512
00:50:06,338 --> 00:50:07,714
...very impressive.

513
00:50:07,881 --> 00:50:10,550
- So where are we off to next?
- Oh, it's too late for that, Peregrin.

514
00:50:10,717 --> 00:50:12,928
There's no leaving this city.

515
00:50:15,263 --> 00:50:18,391
Help must come to us.

516
00:50:19,976 --> 00:50:22,646
It must be getting near teatime.

517
00:50:22,812 --> 00:50:26,525
Leastways, it would be in decent places
where there is still teatime.

518
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:30,278
We're not in decent places.

519
00:50:35,825 --> 00:50:37,077
Mr. Frodo?

520
00:50:40,121 --> 00:50:41,331
What is it?

521
00:50:43,792 --> 00:50:46,169
It's just a feeling.

522
00:50:48,588 --> 00:50:50,757
I don't think I'll be coming back.

523
00:50:55,262 --> 00:50:57,806
Yes, you will. Of course you will.

524
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:00,308
That's just morbid thinking.

525
00:51:00,767 --> 00:51:03,228
We're going there and back again...

526
00:51:03,395 --> 00:51:05,689
...just like Mr. Bilbo.

527
00:51:06,648 --> 00:51:08,775
You'll see.

528
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:20,579
I think these lands
were once part of the kingdom of Gondor.

529
00:51:24,958 --> 00:51:29,004
Long ago, when there was a king.

530
00:51:49,649 --> 00:51:52,485
Mr. Frodo, look.

531
00:51:54,112 --> 00:51:56,865
The king has got a crown again.

532
00:52:08,001 --> 00:52:12,255
Come on, Hobbits!
Mustn't stop now. This way.

533
00:52:29,105 --> 00:52:33,151
So I imagine this is just
a ceremonial position.

534
00:52:33,318 --> 00:52:37,572
I mean, they don't actually expect me
to do any fighting.

535
00:52:38,406 --> 00:52:41,660
- Do they?
- You're in the service of the steward now.

536
00:52:41,826 --> 00:52:45,205
You'll have to do as you're told,
Peregrin Took.

537
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:51,753
Ridiculous Hobbit.

538
00:52:52,921 --> 00:52:55,131
Guard of the Citadel.

539
00:53:04,641 --> 00:53:06,476
Thank you.

540
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:18,113
There's no more stars.

541
00:53:18,613 --> 00:53:19,823
Is it time?

542
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:22,742
Yes.

543
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:27,038
It's so quiet.

544
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:32,293
It's the deep breath before the plunge.

545
00:53:33,461 --> 00:53:36,339
I don't want to be in a battle...

546
00:53:37,173 --> 00:53:42,137
...but waiting on the edge of one
I can't escape is even worse.

547
00:53:45,682 --> 00:53:49,310
Is there any hope, Gandalf,
for Frodo and Sam?

548
00:53:50,645 --> 00:53:53,773
There never was much hope.

549
00:53:55,734 --> 00:53:57,485
Just a fool's hope.

550
00:54:03,366 --> 00:54:06,161
Our enemy is ready.

551
00:54:06,327 --> 00:54:08,997
His full strength's gathered.

552
00:54:09,164 --> 00:54:12,667
Not only Orcs, but Men as well.

553
00:54:12,834 --> 00:54:15,879
<i>Legions of Haradrim from the south...</i>

554
00:54:16,045 --> 00:54:18,757
<i>...mercenaries from the coast.</i>

555
00:54:18,923 --> 00:54:21,509
<i>All will answer Mordor's call.</i>

556
00:54:21,676 --> 00:54:23,219
Come on.

557
00:54:24,345 --> 00:54:27,682
This will be the end of Gondor
as we know it.

558
00:54:27,849 --> 00:54:31,227
Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.

559
00:54:32,187 --> 00:54:36,524
If the river is taken,
if the garrison at Osgiliath falls...

560
00:54:36,691 --> 00:54:40,361
...the last defense of this city
will be gone.

561
00:54:40,528 --> 00:54:44,574
But we have the White Wizard.
That's got to count for something.

562
00:54:50,455 --> 00:54:52,040
Gandalf?

563
00:54:55,752 --> 00:54:59,422
<i>Sauron has yet to reveal
his deadliest servant...</i>

564
00:54:59,881 --> 00:55:03,718
<i>...the one who will lead
Mordor's armies in war.</i>

565
00:55:03,885 --> 00:55:09,057
<i>The one they say no living man can kill.</i>

566
00:55:10,058 --> 00:55:12,227
The Witch-king of Angmar.

567
00:55:13,311 --> 00:55:15,688
You've met him before.

568
00:55:16,356 --> 00:55:18,942
He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.

569
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:28,201
He is the lord of the Nazgûl...

570
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:31,120
<i>...the greatest of the Nine.</i>

571
00:55:31,287 --> 00:55:34,833
<i>Minas Morgul is his lair.</i>

572
00:55:38,378 --> 00:55:41,923
The Dead City.

573
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:47,303
Very nasty place. Full of enemies.

574
00:55:54,519 --> 00:55:56,688
Quick. Quick.

575
00:55:56,855 --> 00:56:00,859
They will see. They will see.

576
00:56:10,118 --> 00:56:15,415
Come away. Come away.
Look, we have found it.

577
00:56:15,582 --> 00:56:19,460
The way into Mordor.

578
00:56:19,627 --> 00:56:23,965
The secret stair.

579
00:56:24,382 --> 00:56:26,759
Climb.

580
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:49,782
- No, Mr. Frodo!
- Not that way!

581
00:56:54,621 --> 00:56:57,498
- What's it doing?
- No.

582
00:56:57,665 --> 00:57:00,752
- They're calling me.
- No.

583
00:57:30,406 --> 00:57:33,368
Hide! Hide!

584
00:58:16,911 --> 00:58:19,747
I can feel his blade.

585
00:58:31,426 --> 00:58:33,553
We come to it at last.

586
00:58:35,388 --> 00:58:38,266
The great battle of our time.

587
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:20,683
Come away, Hobbits.
We climb. We must climb.

588
00:59:30,568 --> 00:59:33,571
The board is set.

589
00:59:33,738 --> 00:59:36,115
The pieces are moving.

590
00:59:38,826 --> 00:59:41,496
Up, up, up the stairs we go.

591
00:59:41,662 --> 00:59:44,332
And then it's into the tunnel.

592
00:59:44,499 --> 00:59:47,710
Hey, what's in this tunnel?

593
00:59:48,252 --> 00:59:51,005
You listen to me,
and you listen good and proper.

594
00:59:51,172 --> 00:59:54,092
Anything happens to him,
you have me to answer to.

595
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:55,843
One sniff something's not right...

596
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:59,180
...one hair stands up
on the back of my head, it's over.

597
00:59:59,388 --> 01:00:02,058
No more slinker. No more stinker.

598
01:00:02,391 --> 01:00:05,019
You're gone. Got it?

599
01:00:05,895 --> 01:00:07,897
I'm watching you.

600
01:00:13,236 --> 01:00:15,238
What was that about?

601
01:00:15,404 --> 01:00:17,824
Nothing. Just clearing something up.

602
01:00:24,455 --> 01:00:27,333
Peregrin Took, my lad,
there is a task now to be done.

603
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:32,088
Another opportunity for one
of the Shire-folk to prove their great worth.

604
01:00:36,926 --> 01:00:38,511
You must not fail me.

605
01:01:12,753 --> 01:01:15,840
It's been very quiet across the river.

606
01:01:16,007 --> 01:01:18,342
The Orcs are lying low.

607
01:01:18,509 --> 01:01:20,511
The garrison may have moved out.

608
01:01:21,637 --> 01:01:24,348
We've sent scouts to Cair Andros.

609
01:01:24,515 --> 01:01:26,809
If the Orcs attack from the north,
we'll have some warning.

610
01:01:53,127 --> 01:01:54,337
Quiet.

611
01:01:58,424 --> 01:02:00,384
We need 10 more.

612
01:02:21,697 --> 01:02:23,241
Kill him!

613
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:42,969
They're not coming from the north.

614
01:02:44,387 --> 01:02:48,724
- To the river. Quick. Quick.
- Go. Come on.

615
01:02:52,186 --> 01:02:53,771
Faster.

616
01:03:06,909 --> 01:03:09,287
Draw swords.

617
01:04:03,841 --> 01:04:06,427
Hold! Hold them!

618
01:05:26,715 --> 01:05:28,592
What?

619
01:05:41,147 --> 01:05:42,565
Amon Dîn.

620
01:05:48,362 --> 01:05:51,407
The beacon.
The beacon of Amon Dîn is lit.

621
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:58,873
Hope is kindled.

622
01:07:31,257 --> 01:07:35,636
The beacons of Minas Tirith!
The beacons are lit!

623
01:07:36,845 --> 01:07:38,472
Gondor calls for aid.

624
01:07:48,983 --> 01:07:51,902
And Rohan will answer.

625
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:55,114
Muster the Rohirrim.

626
01:08:10,212 --> 01:08:12,172
Assemble the army at Dunharrow.

627
01:08:12,339 --> 01:08:16,719
As many men as can be found.
You have two days.

628
01:08:16,885 --> 01:08:22,182
On the third,
we ride for Gondor and war.

629
01:08:22,683 --> 01:08:24,351
- Forward.
- Very good, sir.

630
01:08:24,518 --> 01:08:25,936
- Gamling.
- My lord.

631
01:08:26,103 --> 01:08:27,730
Make haste
across the Riddermark.

632
01:08:27,896 --> 01:08:30,024
Summon every able-bodied man
to Dunharrow.

633
01:08:30,190 --> 01:08:31,775
I will.

634
01:08:35,863 --> 01:08:39,033
- Will you ride with us?
- Just to the encampment.

635
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:43,120
It's tradition for the women
of the court to farewell the men.

636
01:08:49,668 --> 01:08:51,587
The men have found their captain.

637
01:08:51,754 --> 01:08:55,090
They will follow you into battle,
even to death.

638
01:08:55,257 --> 01:08:56,842
You have given us hope.

639
01:09:00,054 --> 01:09:02,014
Excuse me.

640
01:09:03,349 --> 01:09:04,850
I have a sword.

641
01:09:05,142 --> 01:09:06,518
Please accept it.

642
01:09:07,645 --> 01:09:12,149
I offer you my service, Théoden King.

643
01:09:15,569 --> 01:09:17,655
And gladly I accept it.

644
01:09:18,739 --> 01:09:22,826
You shall be Meriadoc,
esquire of Rohan.

645
01:09:27,706 --> 01:09:28,916
Horse-Men.

646
01:09:29,583 --> 01:09:35,214
I wish I could muster a legion of Dwarves,
fully armed and filthy.

647
01:09:35,589 --> 01:09:38,550
Your kinsmen may have no need
to ride to war.

648
01:09:38,717 --> 01:09:42,137
I fear war already marches
on their own lands.

649
01:10:00,614 --> 01:10:04,076
<i>So it is before the walls
of Minas Tirith...</i>

650
01:10:04,243 --> 01:10:08,122
<i>...the doom of our time will be decided.</i>

651
01:10:10,708 --> 01:10:16,255
Now is the hour.
Riders of Rohan, oaths you have taken.

652
01:10:16,422 --> 01:10:20,801
Now, fulfill them all.
To lord and land! Hyah!

653
01:11:03,051 --> 01:11:05,012
Faramir!

654
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:15,022
We can't hold them. The city is lost.

655
01:11:15,606 --> 01:11:18,692
Tell the men to break cover.
We ride for Minas Tirith.

656
01:11:27,451 --> 01:11:29,703
Nazgûl.

657
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,541
Take cover!

658
01:11:34,708 --> 01:11:37,252
Nazgûl!

659
01:11:37,419 --> 01:11:41,089
Fall back. Fall back to Minas Tirith!

660
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:49,556
Fall back!

661
01:11:56,605 --> 01:12:01,193
- Retreat! Retreat!
- Run for your lives!

662
01:12:25,425 --> 01:12:29,763
The age of Men is over.

663
01:12:29,930 --> 01:12:35,561
The time of the Orc has come.

664
01:12:37,938 --> 01:12:40,274
- Keep going.
- It's the Nazgûl.

665
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:44,278
Take cover, my lord!

666
01:12:44,570 --> 01:12:45,904
It's coming!

667
01:12:51,451 --> 01:12:54,830
- It's Mithrandir.
- The White Rider!

668
01:13:34,786 --> 01:13:36,163
Pull!

669
01:13:53,889 --> 01:13:56,308
Mithrandir.

670
01:13:56,475 --> 01:13:58,226
They broke through our defenses.

671
01:13:58,393 --> 01:14:00,604
They've taken the bridge
and the west bank.

672
01:14:01,688 --> 01:14:03,690
Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river.

673
01:14:03,857 --> 01:14:05,859
It is as the Lord Denethor predicted.

674
01:14:06,026 --> 01:14:10,572
- Long has he foreseen this doom.
- Foreseen and done nothing.

675
01:14:13,951 --> 01:14:16,370
Faramir?

676
01:14:18,288 --> 01:14:22,125
This is not the first Halfling
to have crossed your path.

677
01:14:22,292 --> 01:14:24,503
No.

678
01:14:25,837 --> 01:14:27,381
You've seen Frodo and Sam?

679
01:14:28,256 --> 01:14:31,677
- Where? When?
- In Ithilien.

680
01:14:31,843 --> 01:14:33,929
Not two days ago.

681
01:14:34,388 --> 01:14:38,850
Gandalf, they're taking the road
to the Morgul Vale.

682
01:14:39,559 --> 01:14:42,187
And then the pass of Cirith Ungol.

683
01:14:44,398 --> 01:14:46,775
What does that mean?

684
01:14:46,942 --> 01:14:51,863
- What's wrong?
- Faramir, tell me everything.

685
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:54,074
Tell me all you know.

686
01:14:55,242 --> 01:14:58,662
This is how you would serve your city?

687
01:14:58,829 --> 01:15:02,124
You would risk its utter ruin?

688
01:15:03,166 --> 01:15:04,751
I did what I judged to be right.

689
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:08,463
What you judged to be right.

690
01:15:09,089 --> 01:15:14,970
You sent the Ring of Power into Mordor
in the hands of a witless Halfling.

691
01:15:18,932 --> 01:15:23,770
It should have been brought back
to the Citadel to be kept safe.

692
01:15:25,397 --> 01:15:26,940
Hidden.

693
01:15:27,357 --> 01:15:30,110
Dark and deep in the vaults...

694
01:15:30,277 --> 01:15:32,446
...not to be used.

695
01:15:36,616 --> 01:15:41,496
Unless at the uttermost end of need.

696
01:15:41,955 --> 01:15:43,999
I would not use the Ring.

697
01:15:44,166 --> 01:15:47,252
Not if Minas Tirith were falling in ruin
and I alone could save her.

698
01:15:47,586 --> 01:15:52,424
Ever you desire to appear lordly
and gracious...

699
01:15:52,591 --> 01:15:54,843
...as a king of old.

700
01:15:56,636 --> 01:16:00,390
Boromir would have remembered
his father's need.

701
01:16:00,807 --> 01:16:03,268
He would have brought me a kingly gift.

702
01:16:03,477 --> 01:16:06,021
Boromir would not
have brought the Ring.

703
01:16:06,438 --> 01:16:09,566
He would have stretched out his hand to
this thing and taken it. He would've fallen.

704
01:16:09,733 --> 01:16:11,985
- You know nothing of this matter!
- He would have kept it for his own.

705
01:16:13,862 --> 01:16:16,031
And when he returned...

706
01:16:17,157 --> 01:16:18,825
...you would not have known your son.

707
01:16:18,992 --> 01:16:21,536
Boromir was loyal to me!

708
01:16:21,703 --> 01:16:24,289
Not some wizard's pupil!

709
01:16:32,422 --> 01:16:33,757
Father?

710
01:16:46,436 --> 01:16:48,355
My son.

711
01:17:14,589 --> 01:17:15,966
Leave me.

712
01:17:49,541 --> 01:17:52,085
Careful, master. Careful.

713
01:17:52,419 --> 01:17:55,338
Very far to fall.

714
01:17:57,841 --> 01:18:01,761
Very dangerous are the stairs.

715
01:18:04,431 --> 01:18:06,975
Come, master.

716
01:18:12,772 --> 01:18:15,942
Come to Sméagol.

717
01:18:22,282 --> 01:18:23,783
Mr. Frodo.

718
01:18:24,784 --> 01:18:26,328
Get back, you!

719
01:18:26,494 --> 01:18:28,705
Don't touch him!

720
01:18:32,834 --> 01:18:35,670
Why does he hates poor Sméagol?

721
01:18:35,837 --> 01:18:39,549
What has Sméagol ever done to him?

722
01:18:39,716 --> 01:18:41,051
Master?

723
01:18:42,886 --> 01:18:46,348
Master carries heavy burden.

724
01:18:46,514 --> 01:18:51,937
Sméagol knows.
Heavy, heavy burden.

725
01:18:52,103 --> 01:18:55,357
Fat one cannot know.

726
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:00,153
Sméagol look after master.

727
01:19:01,363 --> 01:19:03,573
He wants it.

728
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:08,286
He needs it.
Sméagol sees it in his eye.

729
01:19:08,453 --> 01:19:13,917
Very soon he will ask you for it.
You will see.

730
01:19:14,084 --> 01:19:17,963
The fat one will take it from you.

731
01:19:25,178 --> 01:19:29,516
Send forth all legions.

732
01:19:29,683 --> 01:19:33,728
Do not stop the attack
until the city is taken.

733
01:19:34,437 --> 01:19:37,565
Slay them all.

734
01:19:39,234 --> 01:19:45,031
- What of the wizard?
- I will break him.

735
01:19:48,368 --> 01:19:50,787
Where are Théoden's riders?

736
01:19:50,954 --> 01:19:53,540
Will Rohan's army come?

737
01:19:53,707 --> 01:19:55,959
Mithrandir.

738
01:19:57,002 --> 01:20:00,880
Courage is the best defense
that you have now.

739
01:20:05,677 --> 01:20:08,388
What were you thinking, Peregrin Took?

740
01:20:10,473 --> 01:20:16,187
What service can a Hobbit
offer such a great lord of Men?

741
01:20:16,354 --> 01:20:17,856
It was well-done.

742
01:20:21,026 --> 01:20:25,071
A generous deed should not
be checked with cold counsel.

743
01:20:25,822 --> 01:20:28,366
You are to join the tower guard.

744
01:20:28,908 --> 01:20:31,911
I didn't think they would find any livery
that would fit me.

745
01:20:32,078 --> 01:20:34,539
Once belonged to a young boy
of the city.

746
01:20:34,706 --> 01:20:36,249
A very foolish one...

747
01:20:36,416 --> 01:20:40,670
...who wasted many hours slaying dragons
instead of attending to his studies.

748
01:20:40,837 --> 01:20:43,590
- This was yours?
- Yes, it was mine.

749
01:20:43,757 --> 01:20:45,550
My father had it made for me.

750
01:20:46,593 --> 01:20:47,927
Well...

751
01:20:48,094 --> 01:20:50,096
...I'm taller than you were then.

752
01:20:50,263 --> 01:20:53,600
Though I'm not likely to grow anymore,
except sideways.

753
01:20:56,561 --> 01:20:58,605
Never fitted me either.

754
01:20:58,772 --> 01:21:01,608
Boromir was always the soldier.

755
01:21:04,611 --> 01:21:07,030
They were so alike, he and my father.

756
01:21:09,115 --> 01:21:10,742
Proud.

757
01:21:10,909 --> 01:21:12,118
Stubborn even.

758
01:21:13,870 --> 01:21:15,372
But strong.

759
01:21:16,873 --> 01:21:20,043
I think you have strength
of a different kind.

760
01:21:20,668 --> 01:21:23,129
And one day your father will see it.

761
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:31,096
Here do I swear fealty
and service to Gondor...

762
01:21:31,262 --> 01:21:32,764
...in peace or war...

763
01:21:33,390 --> 01:21:35,850
...in living or dying...

764
01:21:37,227 --> 01:21:38,478
...from...

765
01:21:41,147 --> 01:21:43,942
From this hour henceforth...

766
01:21:44,109 --> 01:21:46,027
...until my lord release me...

767
01:21:47,529 --> 01:21:49,739
...or death take me.

768
01:21:50,323 --> 01:21:52,826
And I shall not forget it...

769
01:21:52,992 --> 01:21:56,371
...nor fail to reward
that which is given.

770
01:22:03,962 --> 01:22:06,256
Fealty with love.

771
01:22:07,340 --> 01:22:09,008
Valor with honor.

772
01:22:10,593 --> 01:22:13,930
Disloyalty with vengeance.

773
01:22:22,564 --> 01:22:26,651
I do not think we should so lightly
abandon the outer defenses...

774
01:22:26,818 --> 01:22:29,571
...defenses that your brother
long held intact.

775
01:22:29,737 --> 01:22:32,240
- What would you have me do?
- I will not yield...

776
01:22:32,407 --> 01:22:35,201
...the river in Pelennor unfought.

777
01:22:35,368 --> 01:22:37,036
Osgiliath must be retaken.

778
01:22:37,203 --> 01:22:39,247
My lord, Osgiliath is overrun.

779
01:22:39,914 --> 01:22:42,709
Much must be risked in war.

780
01:22:45,336 --> 01:22:49,299
Is there a captain here who still has
the courage to do his lord's will?

781
01:22:55,513 --> 01:22:58,766
You wish now that our places
had been exchanged...

782
01:22:59,726 --> 01:23:02,562
...that I had died
and Boromir had lived.

783
01:23:05,982 --> 01:23:07,734
Yes.

784
01:23:08,401 --> 01:23:10,612
I wish that.

785
01:23:18,995 --> 01:23:21,498
Since you were robbed
of Boromir...

786
01:23:23,333 --> 01:23:26,252
...I will do what I can
in his stead.

787
01:23:34,427 --> 01:23:38,890
If I should return,
think better of me, Father.

788
01:23:40,975 --> 01:23:44,604
That will depend on the manner
of your return.

789
01:24:44,038 --> 01:24:45,873
Ugh.

790
01:25:07,895 --> 01:25:10,231
What are you up to?

791
01:25:10,398 --> 01:25:11,649
Sneaking off, are we?

792
01:25:12,358 --> 01:25:14,193
Sneaking?

793
01:25:15,194 --> 01:25:17,363
Sneaking?

794
01:25:18,781 --> 01:25:21,951
Fat Hobbit is always so polite.

795
01:25:22,118 --> 01:25:27,206
Sméagol shows them secret ways
that nobody else could find...

796
01:25:27,373 --> 01:25:29,542
...and they say "sneak."

797
01:25:30,168 --> 01:25:32,754
Sneak?

798
01:25:33,379 --> 01:25:36,090
Very nice friend.
Oh, yes, my precious.

799
01:25:36,257 --> 01:25:38,885
- Very nice, very nice.
- All right. All right!

800
01:25:40,136 --> 01:25:42,347
You just startled me is all.

801
01:25:42,847 --> 01:25:44,682
What were you doing?

802
01:25:46,309 --> 01:25:48,436
Sneaking.

803
01:25:48,811 --> 01:25:51,898
Fine. Have it your own way.

804
01:25:54,150 --> 01:25:56,653
I'm sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo.

805
01:25:57,028 --> 01:25:58,988
We have to be moving on.

806
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:05,745
It's dark still.

807
01:26:05,912 --> 01:26:08,122
It's always dark here.

808
01:26:12,377 --> 01:26:14,295
It's gone!

809
01:26:15,505 --> 01:26:18,383
- The Elven bread.
- What?

810
01:26:18,549 --> 01:26:20,009
That's all we have left.

811
01:26:24,097 --> 01:26:26,599
He took it. He must have!

812
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:30,353
Sméagol?
No, no, not poor Sméagol.

813
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:33,439
Sméagol hates nasty Elf bread.

814
01:26:33,606 --> 01:26:36,776
You're a lying rat!
What did you do with it?!

815
01:26:36,943 --> 01:26:38,486
He doesn't eat it.

816
01:26:39,487 --> 01:26:41,823
- He can't have taken it.
- Look.

817
01:26:42,865 --> 01:26:44,701
What's this?

818
01:26:47,370 --> 01:26:50,707
Crumbs on his jacketses.
He took it!

819
01:26:51,416 --> 01:26:53,084
He took it.

820
01:26:53,918 --> 01:26:58,131
I seen him. He's always stuffing
his face when master's not looking.

821
01:26:58,297 --> 01:27:00,091
That's a filthy lie!

822
01:27:00,258 --> 01:27:02,468
You stinking, two-faced sneak!

823
01:27:02,635 --> 01:27:03,886
- Sam!
- Call me--

824
01:27:04,053 --> 01:27:05,304
Stop it!

825
01:27:06,931 --> 01:27:08,641
Sam!

826
01:27:08,808 --> 01:27:12,437
- I'll kill him!
- Sam! No!

827
01:27:13,479 --> 01:27:19,026
Oh, my-- I'm sorry. I didn't mean it
to go so far. I was just so-- So angry.

828
01:27:19,193 --> 01:27:21,320
Here, just--
Let's just rest a bit.

829
01:27:21,487 --> 01:27:23,573
- I'm all right.
- No.

830
01:27:23,740 --> 01:27:26,826
No, you're not all right.
You're exhausted.

831
01:27:26,993 --> 01:27:29,120
It's that Gollum.

832
01:27:29,287 --> 01:27:30,997
It's this place.

833
01:27:31,164 --> 01:27:33,750
It's that thing around your neck.

834
01:27:37,253 --> 01:27:38,546
I could help a bit.

835
01:27:38,713 --> 01:27:41,382
I could carry it for a while.

836
01:27:41,549 --> 01:27:43,301
Carry it for a while.

837
01:27:43,468 --> 01:27:44,719
I could carry it...I could carry it.

838
01:27:45,344 --> 01:27:50,808
Share the load...Share the load...
the load...the load.

839
01:27:50,975 --> 01:27:52,185
Get away!

840
01:27:52,351 --> 01:27:53,936
I don't want to keep it.

841
01:27:57,523 --> 01:27:59,525
I just want to help.

842
01:28:01,569 --> 01:28:04,197
See? See?

843
01:28:04,363 --> 01:28:07,784
He wants it for himself.

844
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:09,660
Shut up, you!

845
01:28:10,203 --> 01:28:12,038
Go away!
Get out of here!

846
01:28:12,205 --> 01:28:14,040
No, Sam.

847
01:28:14,207 --> 01:28:15,458
It's you.

848
01:28:19,670 --> 01:28:21,380
I'm sorry, Sam.

849
01:28:23,049 --> 01:28:24,425
But he's a liar.

850
01:28:24,592 --> 01:28:27,261
He's poisoned you against me.

851
01:28:28,679 --> 01:28:30,598
You can't help me anymore.

852
01:28:32,558 --> 01:28:34,435
You don't mean that.

853
01:28:36,938 --> 01:28:38,731
Go home.

854
01:29:58,769 --> 01:30:00,563
Faramir!

855
01:30:00,730 --> 01:30:02,648
Faramir!

856
01:30:04,150 --> 01:30:06,193
Your father's will has turned
to madness.

857
01:30:07,361 --> 01:30:09,405
Do not throw away your life
so rashly.

858
01:30:10,156 --> 01:30:12,491
Where does my allegiance lie
if not here?

859
01:30:13,117 --> 01:30:16,037
This is the city of the Men of Númenor.

860
01:30:16,662 --> 01:30:19,457
I will gladly give my life
to defend her beauty...

861
01:30:19,624 --> 01:30:22,835
...her memory, her wisdom.

862
01:30:25,212 --> 01:30:28,633
Your father loves you, Faramir.

863
01:30:29,342 --> 01:30:32,345
He will remember it
before the end.

864
01:31:41,956 --> 01:31:43,499
Can you sing, Master Hobbit?

865
01:31:46,377 --> 01:31:47,878
Well...

866
01:31:48,421 --> 01:31:50,047
...yes.

867
01:31:50,756 --> 01:31:54,510
At least, well enough
for my own people.

868
01:31:56,137 --> 01:31:58,556
But we have no songs
for great halls...

869
01:31:59,598 --> 01:32:00,850
...and evil times.

870
01:32:01,684 --> 01:32:04,854
And why should your songs
be unfit for my halls?

871
01:32:07,648 --> 01:32:09,066
Come, sing me a song.

872
01:32:20,119 --> 01:32:23,456
<i>Home is behind</i>

873
01:32:23,622 --> 01:32:27,376
<i>The world ahead</i>

874
01:32:29,795 --> 01:32:35,634
<i>And there are many paths to tread</i>

875
01:32:37,428 --> 01:32:40,973
<i>Through shadow</i>

876
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:45,311
<i>To the edge of night</i>

877
01:32:46,979 --> 01:32:52,068
<i>Until the stars are all alight</i>

878
01:32:55,071 --> 01:32:59,408
<i>Mist and shadow</i>

879
01:32:59,575 --> 01:33:03,871
<i>Cloud and shade</i>

880
01:33:06,248 --> 01:33:09,585
<i>All shall fade</i>

881
01:33:11,962 --> 01:33:15,966
<i>All shall</i>

882
01:33:21,722 --> 01:33:24,100
<i>Fade</i>

883
01:33:48,499 --> 01:33:51,961
March! March!

884
01:33:52,128 --> 01:33:57,258
March! March! March!

885
01:34:00,803 --> 01:34:03,139
Make way for the king.

886
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:06,642
Make way.

887
01:34:09,103 --> 01:34:11,147
The king is here.

888
01:34:13,107 --> 01:34:14,733
My lord.

889
01:34:15,985 --> 01:34:17,945
Hail to you, sire.

890
01:34:18,404 --> 01:34:19,613
Grimbold, how many?

891
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:22,241
I bring 500 men from the Westfold,
my lord.

892
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:25,870
We have 300 more
from Fenmarch, Théoden King.

893
01:34:26,996 --> 01:34:30,958
- Where are the riders from Snowbourn?
- None have come, my lord.

894
01:34:48,017 --> 01:34:50,144
Six thousand spears.

895
01:34:51,187 --> 01:34:53,189
Less than half of what I'd hoped for.

896
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:56,859
Six thousand will not be enough
to break the lines of Mordor.

897
01:34:59,612 --> 01:35:01,363
More will come.

898
01:35:01,739 --> 01:35:04,700
Every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat.

899
01:35:04,867 --> 01:35:07,453
We have till dawn,
then we must ride.

900
01:35:26,931 --> 01:35:29,266
The horses are restless...

901
01:35:29,433 --> 01:35:30,935
...and the men are quiet.

902
01:35:31,393 --> 01:35:34,521
They grow nervous in the shadow
of the mountain.

903
01:35:36,982 --> 01:35:38,859
That road there...

904
01:35:39,777 --> 01:35:41,862
...where does that lead?

905
01:35:42,613 --> 01:35:46,450
It is the road to the Dimholt,
the door under the mountain.

906
01:35:47,159 --> 01:35:50,162
None who venture there ever return.

907
01:35:51,372 --> 01:35:53,249
That mountain is evil.

908
01:36:04,593 --> 01:36:06,679
Hold!

909
01:36:16,188 --> 01:36:18,023
Aragorn.

910
01:36:18,774 --> 01:36:20,693
Let's find some food.

911
01:36:37,209 --> 01:36:38,627
There.

912
01:36:39,545 --> 01:36:42,548
A true esquire of Rohan.

913
01:36:46,218 --> 01:36:47,886
I'm ready.

914
01:36:49,805 --> 01:36:51,056
Sorry.

915
01:36:51,223 --> 01:36:53,517
It isn't all that dangerous.

916
01:36:54,018 --> 01:36:56,353
It's not even sharp.

917
01:36:57,021 --> 01:37:00,399
Well, that's no good. You won't kill
many Orcs with a blunt blade.

918
01:37:00,566 --> 01:37:02,067
Come on.

919
01:37:06,238 --> 01:37:08,741
To the smithy. Go!

920
01:37:10,242 --> 01:37:12,745
You should not encourage him.

921
01:37:12,953 --> 01:37:15,414
You should not doubt him.

922
01:37:15,581 --> 01:37:18,876
I do not doubt his heart,
only the reach of his arm.

923
01:37:21,587 --> 01:37:23,172
Why should Merry be left behind?

924
01:37:23,339 --> 01:37:25,966
He has as much cause
to go to war as you.

925
01:37:28,093 --> 01:37:31,263
Why can he not fight
for those he loves?

926
01:37:34,558 --> 01:37:37,561
You know as little of war
as that Hobbit.

927
01:37:38,771 --> 01:37:40,898
When the fear takes him...

928
01:37:41,065 --> 01:37:46,111
...and the blood and the screams
and the horror of battle take hold...

929
01:37:46,487 --> 01:37:48,614
...do you think he would stand and fight?

930
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:52,785
He would flee.

931
01:37:52,993 --> 01:37:55,037
And he would be right to do so.

932
01:37:57,247 --> 01:38:01,210
War is the province of Men, Éowyn.

933
01:38:36,829 --> 01:38:40,582
<i>I choose a mortal life.</i>

934
01:38:43,502 --> 01:38:46,338
I wish I could've seen him...

935
01:38:47,506 --> 01:38:50,175
...one last time.

936
01:39:01,353 --> 01:39:02,813
Sir?

937
01:39:04,648 --> 01:39:07,192
King Théoden awaits you, my lord.

938
01:39:28,005 --> 01:39:29,965
I take my leave.

939
01:39:44,605 --> 01:39:45,856
My lord Elrond.

940
01:39:46,398 --> 01:39:49,902
I come on behalf of one whom I love.

941
01:39:53,030 --> 01:39:55,032
Arwen is dying.

942
01:39:59,828 --> 01:40:03,874
She will not long survive the evil
that now spreads from Mordor.

943
01:40:04,625 --> 01:40:08,003
The light of the Evenstar is failing.

944
01:40:08,170 --> 01:40:12,174
As Sauron's power grows,
her strength wanes.

945
01:40:12,341 --> 01:40:16,094
Arwen's life is now tied
to the fate of the Ring.

946
01:40:16,845 --> 01:40:19,431
The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn.

947
01:40:19,765 --> 01:40:21,433
The end has come.

948
01:40:21,850 --> 01:40:24,436
It will not be our end, but his.

949
01:40:25,229 --> 01:40:28,774
You ride to war, but not to victory.

950
01:40:29,775 --> 01:40:33,445
Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith,
this you know.

951
01:40:33,654 --> 01:40:38,075
But in secret he sends another force
which will attack from the river.

952
01:40:38,534 --> 01:40:41,954
<i>A fleet of Corsair ships sails
from the south.</i>

953
01:40:42,579 --> 01:40:44,665
They'll be in the city in two days.

954
01:40:45,165 --> 01:40:47,960
You're outnumbered, Aragorn.

955
01:40:48,710 --> 01:40:50,796
You need more men.

956
01:40:51,213 --> 01:40:52,965
There are none.

957
01:40:54,716 --> 01:40:58,637
There are those who dwell
in the mountain.

958
01:41:07,646 --> 01:41:09,815
Murderers...

959
01:41:09,982 --> 01:41:11,400
...traitors.

960
01:41:13,819 --> 01:41:15,988
You would call upon them to fight?

961
01:41:16,196 --> 01:41:17,781
They believe in nothing.

962
01:41:17,948 --> 01:41:20,075
They answer to no one.

963
01:41:20,242 --> 01:41:23,328
They will answer
to the king of Gondor.

964
01:41:30,460 --> 01:41:35,591
Andúril, the Flame of the West,
forged from the shards of Narsil.

965
01:41:49,855 --> 01:41:54,318
Sauron will not have forgotten
the Sword of Elendil.

966
01:42:08,373 --> 01:42:13,128
The blade that was broken
shall return to Minas Tirith.

967
01:42:13,295 --> 01:42:15,714
The man who can wield
the power of this sword...

968
01:42:15,881 --> 01:42:19,760
...can summon to him an army more
deadly than any that walks this earth.

969
01:42:21,553 --> 01:42:23,722
Put aside the Ranger.

970
01:42:23,889 --> 01:42:27,225
Become who you were born to be.

971
01:42:27,392 --> 01:42:29,394
Take the Dimholt road.

972
01:42:33,398 --> 01:42:36,234
I give hope to Men.

973
01:42:39,488 --> 01:42:43,575
I keep none for myself.

974
01:42:55,420 --> 01:42:57,089
Why are you doing this?

975
01:42:57,589 --> 01:43:00,801
The war lies to the east.
You cannot leave on the eve of battle.

976
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:05,305
You cannot abandon the men.

977
01:43:06,598 --> 01:43:08,183
Éowyn...

978
01:43:08,350 --> 01:43:10,560
We need you here.

979
01:43:11,687 --> 01:43:13,563
Why have you come?

980
01:43:15,232 --> 01:43:17,192
Do you not know?

981
01:43:26,451 --> 01:43:29,454
It is but a shadow and a thought
that you love.

982
01:43:33,417 --> 01:43:35,836
I cannot give you what you seek.

983
01:43:49,349 --> 01:43:53,270
I have wished you joy
since first I saw you.

984
01:44:12,414 --> 01:44:14,666
Just where do you think you're off to?

985
01:44:14,875 --> 01:44:16,168
Not this time.

986
01:44:16,376 --> 01:44:18,587
- This time you must stay, Gimli.
- Mm.

987
01:44:21,298 --> 01:44:24,134
Have you learned nothing
of the stubbornness of Dwarves?

988
01:44:24,301 --> 01:44:27,971
You might as well accept it.
We're going with you, laddie.

989
01:44:50,285 --> 01:44:52,454
- What's happening?
- Where is he going?

990
01:44:52,788 --> 01:44:54,664
Where's he going?

991
01:44:57,209 --> 01:44:59,294
I don't understand.

992
01:45:03,715 --> 01:45:05,509
Lord Aragorn!

993
01:45:05,926 --> 01:45:08,637
Why does he leave on the eve of battle?

994
01:45:09,846 --> 01:45:11,932
He leaves because there is no hope.

995
01:45:12,557 --> 01:45:14,726
He leaves because he must.

996
01:45:14,893 --> 01:45:16,561
Too few have come.

997
01:45:16,728 --> 01:45:18,939
We cannot defeat
the armies of Mordor.

998
01:45:21,441 --> 01:45:23,068
No...

999
01:45:23,527 --> 01:45:24,736
...we cannot.

1000
01:45:27,656 --> 01:45:31,451
But we will meet them
in battle nonetheless.

1001
01:45:45,882 --> 01:45:47,592
I have left instruction.

1002
01:45:50,262 --> 01:45:53,557
The people are to follow
your rule in my stead.

1003
01:46:00,105 --> 01:46:02,399
Take up my seat in the Golden Hall.

1004
01:46:03,608 --> 01:46:06,444
Long may you defend Edoras...

1005
01:46:06,611 --> 01:46:08,989
...if the battle goes ill.

1006
01:46:10,073 --> 01:46:13,493
What other duty would you
have me do, my lord?

1007
01:46:15,704 --> 01:46:17,622
Duty?

1008
01:46:19,791 --> 01:46:21,126
No.

1009
01:46:29,467 --> 01:46:31,595
I would have you smile again...

1010
01:46:35,015 --> 01:46:40,020
...not grieve for those
whose time has come.

1011
01:46:44,816 --> 01:46:48,320
You shall live to see
these days renewed...

1012
01:46:52,657 --> 01:46:55,452
...and no more despair.

1013
01:47:01,666 --> 01:47:05,337
What kind of army would linger
in such a place?

1014
01:47:05,545 --> 01:47:07,339
One that is cursed.

1015
01:47:09,341 --> 01:47:11,843
Long ago, the Men of the Mountains
swore an oath...

1016
01:47:12,302 --> 01:47:15,055
...to the last king of Gondor...

1017
01:47:15,639 --> 01:47:17,182
...to come to his aid...

1018
01:47:17,349 --> 01:47:19,100
...to fight.

1019
01:47:19,601 --> 01:47:21,770
But when the time came...

1020
01:47:22,354 --> 01:47:25,023
...when Gondor's need was dire...

1021
01:47:25,190 --> 01:47:27,025
...they fled...

1022
01:47:27,192 --> 01:47:30,612
...vanishing into the darkness
of the mountain.

1023
01:47:31,655 --> 01:47:33,990
And so Isildur cursed them...

1024
01:47:35,533 --> 01:47:39,371
...never to rest until they had
fulfilled their pledge.

1025
01:47:43,708 --> 01:47:46,878
Who shall call them
from the Grey twilight?

1026
01:47:47,337 --> 01:47:49,547
The forgotten people.

1027
01:47:49,714 --> 01:47:52,217
The heir of him to whom
the oath they swore.

1028
01:47:52,717 --> 01:47:54,594
From the north shall he come.

1029
01:47:55,095 --> 01:47:56,721
Need shall drive him.

1030
01:47:57,847 --> 01:48:01,351
He shall pass the door
to the Paths of the Dead.

1031
01:48:19,828 --> 01:48:23,123
The very warmth of my blood
seems stolen away.

1032
01:48:28,670 --> 01:48:30,630
The way is shut.

1033
01:48:31,381 --> 01:48:33,341
It was made by those
who are dead.

1034
01:48:33,925 --> 01:48:36,219
And the Dead keep it.

1035
01:48:36,761 --> 01:48:38,263
The way is shut.

1036
01:48:49,649 --> 01:48:51,151
Brego!

1037
01:48:54,654 --> 01:48:57,365
I do not fear death.

1038
01:49:09,669 --> 01:49:12,088
Well, this is a thing unheard-of.

1039
01:49:12,255 --> 01:49:16,926
An Elf will go underground
where a Dwarf dare not?

1040
01:49:17,093 --> 01:49:18,428
Oh.

1041
01:49:18,595 --> 01:49:21,431
Oh, I'd never hear the end of it.

1042
01:49:36,446 --> 01:49:38,656
We must ride light and swift.

1043
01:49:38,823 --> 01:49:40,617
It is a long road ahead.

1044
01:49:40,784 --> 01:49:43,828
And man and beast must reach the end
with the strength to fight.

1045
01:49:49,334 --> 01:49:52,337
Little Hobbits do not belong in war,
Master Meriadoc.

1046
01:49:52,712 --> 01:49:54,672
All my friends have gone to battle.

1047
01:49:54,839 --> 01:49:56,758
I would be ashamed to be left behind.

1048
01:49:56,925 --> 01:49:59,010
It is a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith.

1049
01:49:59,219 --> 01:50:01,596
And none of my riders can bear you
as a burden.

1050
01:50:02,597 --> 01:50:04,724
I want to fight.

1051
01:50:05,225 --> 01:50:07,227
I will say no more.

1052
01:50:24,035 --> 01:50:25,995
Ride with me.

1053
01:50:27,455 --> 01:50:28,873
My lady.

1054
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:31,376
Form up! Move out!

1055
01:50:31,543 --> 01:50:34,796
Form up! Move out!

1056
01:50:37,882 --> 01:50:39,050
Ride!

1057
01:50:39,259 --> 01:50:42,220
Ride now to Gondor!

1058
01:51:23,845 --> 01:51:25,597
What is it?

1059
01:51:25,763 --> 01:51:27,307
What do you see?

1060
01:51:27,557 --> 01:51:29,684
I see shapes of men.

1061
01:51:32,353 --> 01:51:33,730
And of horses.

1062
01:51:34,439 --> 01:51:35,690
Where?

1063
01:51:35,857 --> 01:51:38,818
Pale banners like shreds of cloud.

1064
01:51:41,237 --> 01:51:43,448
Spears rise...

1065
01:51:44,073 --> 01:51:47,535
...like winter-thickets
through a shroud of mist.

1066
01:51:48,786 --> 01:51:50,955
The Dead are following.

1067
01:51:52,123 --> 01:51:53,625
They have been summoned.

1068
01:51:54,334 --> 01:51:56,127
The Dead?

1069
01:51:56,544 --> 01:51:58,254
Summoned?

1070
01:51:58,630 --> 01:52:00,548
I knew that.

1071
01:52:01,090 --> 01:52:03,259
Huh. Ha.

1072
01:52:03,885 --> 01:52:05,637
Very good.

1073
01:52:06,346 --> 01:52:08,431
Very good! Legolas!

1074
01:52:46,386 --> 01:52:47,804
Do not look down.

1075
01:53:40,398 --> 01:53:45,528
<i>Who enters my domain?</i>

1076
01:53:49,240 --> 01:53:51,492
One who will have your allegiance.

1077
01:53:54,454 --> 01:53:59,751
The Dead do not suffer the living to pass.

1078
01:54:00,084 --> 01:54:02,754
You will suffer me.

1079
01:54:26,277 --> 01:54:29,697
The way is shut.

1080
01:54:30,865 --> 01:54:35,286
It was made by those who are dead.

1081
01:54:35,703 --> 01:54:39,874
And the Dead keep it.

1082
01:54:49,008 --> 01:54:52,095
The way is shut.

1083
01:54:53,805 --> 01:54:56,474
Now you must die.

1084
01:55:00,311 --> 01:55:03,147
I summon you to fulfill your oath.

1085
01:55:03,523 --> 01:55:08,486
None but the king of Gondor
may command me.

1086
01:55:14,075 --> 01:55:16,244
That line was broken.

1087
01:55:18,830 --> 01:55:21,082
It has been remade.

1088
01:55:29,006 --> 01:55:30,508
Fight for us...

1089
01:55:30,675 --> 01:55:33,261
...and regain your honor.

1090
01:55:37,432 --> 01:55:38,766
What say you?

1091
01:55:50,987 --> 01:55:52,530
What say you?

1092
01:55:52,697 --> 01:55:55,032
Ah! You waste your time, Aragorn.

1093
01:55:55,199 --> 01:55:58,369
They had no honor in life,
they have none now in death.

1094
01:55:58,870 --> 01:56:01,372
I am Isildur's heir.

1095
01:56:01,956 --> 01:56:03,875
Fight for me...

1096
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:08,087
...and I will hold your oaths fulfilled.

1097
01:56:12,008 --> 01:56:13,968
What say you?

1098
01:56:21,893 --> 01:56:24,103
You have my word!

1099
01:56:24,395 --> 01:56:28,399
Fight, and I will release you
from this living death!

1100
01:56:29,859 --> 01:56:31,360
What say you?!

1101
01:56:34,655 --> 01:56:37,617
Stand, you traitors!

1102
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:05,603
Out!

1103
01:57:26,958 --> 01:57:28,543
Legolas!

1104
01:57:29,669 --> 01:57:30,878
Run!

1105
01:58:37,194 --> 01:58:39,238
We fight.

1106
01:58:49,624 --> 01:58:52,209
Open the gate! Quick!

1107
01:59:23,240 --> 01:59:25,242
Quick! Hurry!

1108
01:59:39,006 --> 01:59:40,591
Faramir!

1109
01:59:41,592 --> 01:59:44,887
Say not that he has fallen.

1110
01:59:46,055 --> 01:59:47,598
They were outnumbered.

1111
01:59:48,015 --> 01:59:49,600
None survived.

1112
01:59:50,309 --> 01:59:52,311
Fear.

1113
01:59:52,853 --> 01:59:56,065
The city is rank with it.

1114
01:59:58,401 --> 02:00:00,861
Let us ease their pain.

1115
02:00:01,112 --> 02:00:02,863
Release the prisoners.

1116
02:00:03,030 --> 02:00:04,949
Catapults!

1117
02:00:08,244 --> 02:00:10,329
Shields up!

1118
02:00:18,337 --> 02:00:21,799
My sons are spent.

1119
02:00:22,842 --> 02:00:25,761
My line has ended.

1120
02:00:28,597 --> 02:00:29,974
He's alive!

1121
02:00:30,141 --> 02:00:33,310
The House of Stewards has failed.

1122
02:00:33,477 --> 02:00:34,979
He needs medicine, my lord.

1123
02:00:35,980 --> 02:00:38,649
My line has ended!

1124
02:00:40,151 --> 02:00:42,153
My lord!

1125
02:00:49,160 --> 02:00:51,245
Put it in!

1126
02:00:55,666 --> 02:00:57,501
Rohan...

1127
02:00:58,294 --> 02:01:00,671
...has deserted us.

1128
02:01:15,144 --> 02:01:18,355
Théoden's betrayed me.

1129
02:01:29,492 --> 02:01:31,327
Abandon your posts!

1130
02:01:32,369 --> 02:01:36,290
Flee! Flee for your lives!

1131
02:01:38,793 --> 02:01:40,628
Oh!

1132
02:01:46,425 --> 02:01:47,968
Prepare for battle!

1133
02:01:48,511 --> 02:01:51,680
Hurry, men! To the wall! Defend the wall!

1134
02:01:52,848 --> 02:01:54,809
Over here!

1135
02:01:55,559 --> 02:01:57,937
Return to your posts!

1136
02:02:08,739 --> 02:02:11,367
Send these foul beasts into the abyss.

1137
02:02:21,544 --> 02:02:23,003
Stay where you are.

1138
02:02:39,979 --> 02:02:41,397
We need more rubble!

1139
02:02:41,564 --> 02:02:43,440
Watch out!

1140
02:02:43,607 --> 02:02:46,110
Down to the lower levels. Quick!

1141
02:02:48,028 --> 02:02:49,572
Double up, men!

1142
02:03:05,629 --> 02:03:07,089
Yah!

1143
02:03:58,557 --> 02:04:01,560
Hold them back! Do not give in to fear.

1144
02:04:02,061 --> 02:04:05,564
Stand to your posts! Fight!

1145
02:04:46,230 --> 02:04:47,856
Not at the towers!

1146
02:04:48,023 --> 02:04:51,026
Aim for the trolls! Kill the trolls!

1147
02:04:51,735 --> 02:04:53,612
Bring them down!

1148
02:05:28,731 --> 02:05:30,774
Fight them back!

1149
02:05:30,941 --> 02:05:32,943
Peregrin Took!

1150
02:05:33,777 --> 02:05:36,947
- Go back to the Citadel!
- They'd called us out to fight.

1151
02:05:52,671 --> 02:05:55,049
This is no place for a Hobbit.

1152
02:06:20,783 --> 02:06:22,242
Guard of the Citadel, indeed.

1153
02:06:22,826 --> 02:06:26,205
Now, back, up the hill. Quickly. Quick!

1154
02:06:37,508 --> 02:06:40,511
What are you doing,
you useless scum?!

1155
02:06:40,677 --> 02:06:42,638
The door won't give. It's too strong.

1156
02:06:48,977 --> 02:06:51,355
Get back there and smash it down.

1157
02:06:51,522 --> 02:06:53,524
But nothing can breach it.

1158
02:06:56,485 --> 02:06:58,737
Grond will breach it.

1159
02:07:02,157 --> 02:07:04,243
Bring up the wolf's head.

1160
02:07:07,371 --> 02:07:12,751
<i>Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond!</i>

1161
02:07:13,043 --> 02:07:16,880
<i>Grond! Grond! Grond!</i>

1162
02:07:18,841 --> 02:07:22,261
<i>Grond! Grond! Grond!</i>

1163
02:07:22,970 --> 02:07:26,640
<i>Grond! Grond! Grond!</i>

1164
02:07:27,057 --> 02:07:31,228
<i>Grond! Grond! Grond!</i>

1165
02:07:31,395 --> 02:07:35,023
<i>Grond! Grond! Grond!</i>

1166
02:07:49,247 --> 02:07:51,041
You may go no further.

1167
02:07:54,252 --> 02:07:56,379
You will not enter Gondor.

1168
02:07:58,048 --> 02:07:59,925
Who are you to deny us passage?

1169
02:08:00,092 --> 02:08:03,887
Legolas, fire a warning shot
past the bosun's ear.

1170
02:08:06,098 --> 02:08:07,766
Mind your aim.

1171
02:08:12,604 --> 02:08:14,272
Oh!

1172
02:08:14,481 --> 02:08:16,900
That's it. Right. We warned you.

1173
02:08:17,067 --> 02:08:18,735
Prepare to be boarded.

1174
02:08:20,570 --> 02:08:21,905
Boarded?

1175
02:08:22,072 --> 02:08:23,740
By you and whose army?

1176
02:08:25,283 --> 02:08:27,577
This army.

1177
02:08:44,261 --> 02:08:46,096
In there.

1178
02:08:47,764 --> 02:08:49,641
What is this place?

1179
02:08:54,020 --> 02:08:57,440
Master must go inside the tunnel.

1180
02:08:58,817 --> 02:09:02,821
Now that I'm here, I don't think I want to.

1181
02:09:04,906 --> 02:09:07,159
It's the only way.

1182
02:09:09,494 --> 02:09:11,496
Go in...

1183
02:09:12,038 --> 02:09:14,291
...or go back.

1184
02:09:16,960 --> 02:09:19,713
I can't go back.

1185
02:09:31,933 --> 02:09:34,644
- What's that smell?
- Orcses' filth.

1186
02:09:34,811 --> 02:09:38,023
Orcses come in here sometimes.

1187
02:09:43,028 --> 02:09:44,863
Hurry.

1188
02:09:49,743 --> 02:09:51,703
This way.

1189
02:09:54,539 --> 02:09:56,374
Sméagol?

1190
02:09:57,334 --> 02:09:59,502
Over here.

1191
02:10:04,341 --> 02:10:05,675
Oh!

1192
02:10:05,842 --> 02:10:07,594
Aah! Aah!

1193
02:10:07,761 --> 02:10:10,931
It's sticky. What is it?

1194
02:10:11,097 --> 02:10:13,391
You'll see.

1195
02:10:13,558 --> 02:10:15,894
Oh, yes.

1196
02:10:16,061 --> 02:10:19,231
You will see.

1197
02:10:28,114 --> 02:10:29,783
Sméagol?

1198
02:10:31,076 --> 02:10:32,410
Sméagol!

1199
02:10:35,080 --> 02:10:37,040
Sméagol!

1200
02:10:46,258 --> 02:10:48,260
Sam.

1201
02:12:28,318 --> 02:12:30,403
<i>And you, Frodo Baggins...</i>

1202
02:12:30,612 --> 02:12:35,992
<i>...I give you the light of Eärendil,
our most beloved star.</i>

1203
02:12:36,743 --> 02:12:40,038
<i>May it be a light for you
in dark places...</i>

1204
02:12:40,205 --> 02:12:43,708
<i>...when all other lights go out.</i>

1205
02:14:00,118 --> 02:14:03,413
<i>Naughty little fly</i>

1206
02:14:03,580 --> 02:14:06,791
<i>Why does he cry?</i>

1207
02:14:07,292 --> 02:14:10,628
<i>Caught in a web</i>

1208
02:14:10,795 --> 02:14:13,590
<i>Soon you'll be...</i>

1209
02:14:13,965 --> 02:14:15,800
Eaten.

1210
02:14:52,962 --> 02:14:55,673
Got away, did it, precious?

1211
02:14:55,840 --> 02:14:57,967
Not this time.

1212
02:14:58,134 --> 02:15:01,179
- Not this time!
- No!

1213
02:15:08,019 --> 02:15:11,356
It wasn't us. It wasn't us!

1214
02:15:11,856 --> 02:15:14,484
Sméagol wouldn't hurt master.

1215
02:15:14,651 --> 02:15:16,528
We promised.

1216
02:15:16,694 --> 02:15:19,197
You must believe us.

1217
02:15:19,364 --> 02:15:21,074
It was the precious.

1218
02:15:21,282 --> 02:15:26,037
The precious made us do it.

1219
02:15:43,179 --> 02:15:46,057
I have to destroy it, Sméagol.

1220
02:15:55,066 --> 02:15:58,403
I have to destroy it for both our sakes.

1221
02:16:08,580 --> 02:16:09,914
No!

1222
02:16:33,146 --> 02:16:35,607
I'm so sorry, Sam.

1223
02:16:40,069 --> 02:16:42,614
I'm so sorry.

1224
02:17:08,389 --> 02:17:13,186
<i>This task was appointed
to you, Frodo of the Shire.</i>

1225
02:17:14,312 --> 02:17:16,773
<i>If you do not find a way...</i>

1226
02:17:17,982 --> 02:17:19,275
<i>...no one will.</i>

1227
02:17:53,059 --> 02:17:55,853
The scouts report
Minas Tirith is surrounded.

1228
02:17:56,020 --> 02:17:58,314
The lower level's in flames.

1229
02:17:58,731 --> 02:18:01,192
Everywhere,
legions of the enemy advance.

1230
02:18:01,359 --> 02:18:02,568
Time is against us.

1231
02:18:03,194 --> 02:18:04,529
Make ready!

1232
02:18:04,696 --> 02:18:06,531
Take heart, Merry.

1233
02:18:06,698 --> 02:18:08,866
It will soon be over.

1234
02:18:09,492 --> 02:18:11,035
My lady...

1235
02:18:11,661 --> 02:18:14,205
...you are fair and brave...

1236
02:18:14,539 --> 02:18:16,999
...and have much to live for...

1237
02:18:18,334 --> 02:18:20,712
...and many who love you.

1238
02:18:23,506 --> 02:18:26,217
I know it is too late to turn aside.

1239
02:18:26,759 --> 02:18:30,012
I know there is not much point
now in hoping.

1240
02:18:31,222 --> 02:18:34,600
If I were a knight of Rohan,
capable of great deeds...

1241
02:18:34,767 --> 02:18:37,895
But I'm not.

1242
02:18:38,062 --> 02:18:39,897
I'm a Hobbit.

1243
02:18:42,608 --> 02:18:45,111
And I know I can't save Middle-earth.

1244
02:18:48,531 --> 02:18:50,867
I just want to help my friends.

1245
02:18:52,910 --> 02:18:54,412
Frodo.

1246
02:18:55,246 --> 02:18:57,039
Sam.

1247
02:18:58,583 --> 02:19:00,626
Pippin.

1248
02:19:02,086 --> 02:19:05,131
More than anything,
I wish I could see them again.

1249
02:19:09,385 --> 02:19:11,721
Prepare to move out!

1250
02:19:11,888 --> 02:19:14,640
Make haste.
We ride through the night.

1251
02:19:31,282 --> 02:19:32,617
To battle.

1252
02:19:33,075 --> 02:19:34,494
To battle.

1253
02:19:57,600 --> 02:19:59,352
Back to the gate!

1254
02:19:59,644 --> 02:20:01,813
Hurry!

1255
02:20:21,707 --> 02:20:26,212
I am steward of the House of Anárion.

1256
02:20:26,379 --> 02:20:28,798
Thus have I walked.

1257
02:20:30,007 --> 02:20:33,094
And thus now will I sleep.

1258
02:20:39,141 --> 02:20:41,227
Gondor is lost.

1259
02:20:41,686 --> 02:20:45,189
There is no hope for Men.

1260
02:20:59,745 --> 02:21:02,623
Why do the fools fly?

1261
02:21:04,166 --> 02:21:07,211
Better to die sooner than late.

1262
02:21:09,380 --> 02:21:11,424
For die we must.

1263
02:21:23,561 --> 02:21:26,647
No tomb for Denethor
and Faramir.

1264
02:21:27,732 --> 02:21:33,738
No long, slow sleep of death embalmed.

1265
02:21:33,905 --> 02:21:39,076
We shall burn,
like the heathen kings of old.

1266
02:21:42,747 --> 02:21:44,540
Bring wood and oil.

1267
02:21:47,376 --> 02:21:48,753
Steady.

1268
02:21:48,920 --> 02:21:50,963
Steady.

1269
02:22:05,394 --> 02:22:07,939
You are soldiers of Gondor.

1270
02:22:08,189 --> 02:22:12,610
No matter what comes through that gate,
you will stand your ground.

1271
02:22:19,116 --> 02:22:20,284
Run!

1272
02:22:22,203 --> 02:22:23,704
Volley!

1273
02:22:24,455 --> 02:22:26,290
Fire!

1274
02:24:19,445 --> 02:24:21,530
Let him go, you filth.

1275
02:24:23,407 --> 02:24:25,076
Let him go!

1276
02:24:26,368 --> 02:24:28,537
You will not touch him again.

1277
02:24:31,624 --> 02:24:33,542
Come on and finish it.

1278
02:26:22,526 --> 02:26:24,862
Ha! Back!

1279
02:26:35,706 --> 02:26:36,999
Mr. Frodo.

1280
02:26:46,550 --> 02:26:48,552
Oh, no.

1281
02:26:48,719 --> 02:26:50,679
Frodo.

1282
02:26:50,971 --> 02:26:52,848
Mr. Frodo.

1283
02:26:57,394 --> 02:26:58,729
Wake up.

1284
02:27:02,566 --> 02:27:04,985
Don't leave me here alone.

1285
02:27:06,487 --> 02:27:08,906
Don't go where I can't follow.

1286
02:27:13,244 --> 02:27:14,578
Wake up.

1287
02:27:21,252 --> 02:27:23,504
Not asleep.

1288
02:27:25,589 --> 02:27:27,549
Dead.

1289
02:27:46,277 --> 02:27:47,778
You get back, you scum!

1290
02:27:57,413 --> 02:27:58,747
What's this?

1291
02:27:59,915 --> 02:28:02,626
Looks like old Shelob's
been having a bit of fun.

1292
02:28:04,628 --> 02:28:07,131
Killed another one, has she?

1293
02:28:07,339 --> 02:28:09,300
No.

1294
02:28:12,052 --> 02:28:14,054
This fellow ain't dead.

1295
02:28:14,346 --> 02:28:16,640
Not dead?

1296
02:28:16,807 --> 02:28:22,646
She jabs him with her stinger,
and he goes as limp as a boned fish.

1297
02:28:22,980 --> 02:28:25,691
Then she has her way with them.

1298
02:28:26,066 --> 02:28:27,776
That's how she likes to feed.

1299
02:28:28,277 --> 02:28:30,362
Fresh blood.

1300
02:28:30,571 --> 02:28:32,865
Get him to the tower!

1301
02:28:36,327 --> 02:28:38,037
Samwise, you fool.

1302
02:28:38,203 --> 02:28:41,040
This scum will be awake
in a couple of hours.

1303
02:28:41,206 --> 02:28:43,709
Then he'll wish he'd never been born.

1304
02:29:08,025 --> 02:29:11,236
The house of his spirit crumbles.

1305
02:29:12,321 --> 02:29:13,739
He is burning.

1306
02:29:14,865 --> 02:29:16,200
Already burning.

1307
02:29:16,617 --> 02:29:18,619
He's not dead.

1308
02:29:19,036 --> 02:29:20,704
He's not dead!

1309
02:29:22,915 --> 02:29:24,708
No! No!

1310
02:29:24,875 --> 02:29:27,211
No! No!

1311
02:29:27,378 --> 02:29:29,380
He's not dead!

1312
02:29:29,755 --> 02:29:33,217
- Farewell, Peregrin, son of Paladin.
- No! No! No!

1313
02:29:33,384 --> 02:29:36,720
I release you from my service.

1314
02:29:38,055 --> 02:29:42,393
Go now and die in what way
seems best to you.

1315
02:29:44,561 --> 02:29:46,897
Pour oil on the wood!

1316
02:29:48,649 --> 02:29:50,692
Come on, soldier! Move it!

1317
02:29:51,193 --> 02:29:54,071
- Hurry along there! Hurry along!
- Gandalf!

1318
02:29:54,446 --> 02:29:55,906
Where is Gandalf?

1319
02:29:57,074 --> 02:29:58,325
Gandalf!

1320
02:30:03,747 --> 02:30:04,915
Retreat!

1321
02:30:07,084 --> 02:30:08,877
The city is breached!

1322
02:30:09,044 --> 02:30:11,964
Fall back to the second level!

1323
02:30:15,759 --> 02:30:17,386
Get the women and children out!

1324
02:30:17,761 --> 02:30:19,471
Get them out!

1325
02:30:19,680 --> 02:30:21,140
Retreat!

1326
02:30:21,306 --> 02:30:23,100
Come on. Come on.

1327
02:30:23,434 --> 02:30:27,729
Move into the city. Kill all in your path.

1328
02:30:35,737 --> 02:30:38,115
Take them down!

1329
02:30:58,635 --> 02:31:01,513
Fight. Fight to the last man!

1330
02:31:01,722 --> 02:31:02,973
Fight for your lives!

1331
02:31:03,140 --> 02:31:04,433
Gandalf!

1332
02:31:08,812 --> 02:31:10,147
Gandalf!

1333
02:31:10,314 --> 02:31:12,941
Denethor has lost his mind!

1334
02:31:13,108 --> 02:31:15,360
He's burning Faramir alive!

1335
02:31:15,527 --> 02:31:17,321
Up! Quickly!

1336
02:31:24,161 --> 02:31:25,662
Go back to the abyss.

1337
02:31:27,164 --> 02:31:30,334
Fall into the nothingness
that awaits you and your master.

1338
02:31:30,501 --> 02:31:37,007
Do you not know death
when you see it, old man?

1339
02:31:37,174 --> 02:31:41,845
This is my hour.

1340
02:31:51,396 --> 02:31:53,023
Gandalf!

1341
02:32:01,865 --> 02:32:05,410
You have failed.

1342
02:32:06,203 --> 02:32:11,041
The world of Men will fall.

1343
02:33:08,348 --> 02:33:09,766
Courage, Merry.

1344
02:33:09,933 --> 02:33:12,352
Courage for our friends.

1345
02:33:15,897 --> 02:33:18,942
Form ranks, you maggots. Form ranks!

1346
02:33:19,109 --> 02:33:22,404
Pikes in front. Archers behind.

1347
02:33:30,454 --> 02:33:33,624
Éomer, take your éored
down the left flank.

1348
02:33:33,790 --> 02:33:35,083
Flank ready.

1349
02:33:35,250 --> 02:33:38,128
Gamling, follow the king's
banner down the center.

1350
02:33:38,295 --> 02:33:41,965
Grimbold, take your company right
after you pass the wall.

1351
02:33:42,132 --> 02:33:44,926
Forth, and fear no darkness!

1352
02:33:45,093 --> 02:33:48,930
Arise, arise, Riders of Théoden!

1353
02:33:49,139 --> 02:33:54,311
Spears shall be shaken,
shields shall be splintered...

1354
02:33:54,519 --> 02:33:58,273
...a sword-day, a red day...

1355
02:33:58,440 --> 02:34:01,985
...ere the sun rises!

1356
02:34:09,785 --> 02:34:14,122
Whatever happens, stay with me.
I'll look after you.

1357
02:34:20,462 --> 02:34:22,506
Ride now!

1358
02:34:24,007 --> 02:34:26,176
Ride now!

1359
02:34:26,718 --> 02:34:29,513
Ride! Ride for ruin...

1360
02:34:29,680 --> 02:34:32,474
...and the world's ending!

1361
02:34:34,351 --> 02:34:35,811
Death!

1362
02:34:36,186 --> 02:34:39,147
Death!

1363
02:34:39,314 --> 02:34:42,526
- Death!
- Death!

1364
02:34:42,984 --> 02:34:44,528
- Death!
- Death!

1365
02:34:45,237 --> 02:34:48,699
- Death!
- Death!

1366
02:34:53,829 --> 02:34:56,206
Forth Eorlingas!

1367
02:35:39,207 --> 02:35:40,917
Fire!

1368
02:35:44,755 --> 02:35:45,922
Death!

1369
02:35:50,135 --> 02:35:51,428
Charge!

1370
02:35:51,928 --> 02:35:53,513
Fire at will!

1371
02:36:50,821 --> 02:36:54,157
Set a fire in our flesh.

1372
02:37:11,800 --> 02:37:13,510
Stay this madness!

1373
02:37:17,848 --> 02:37:22,477
You may triumph in the field of battle
for a day...

1374
02:37:23,019 --> 02:37:26,648
...but against the power that has risen
in the east...

1375
02:37:26,815 --> 02:37:30,026
...there is no victory.

1376
02:37:59,222 --> 02:38:01,016
No!

1377
02:38:01,182 --> 02:38:03,852
You will not take my son from me!

1378
02:38:04,019 --> 02:38:06,354
No! No!

1379
02:38:06,563 --> 02:38:07,898
Yah!

1380
02:38:17,240 --> 02:38:18,909
Faramir.

1381
02:38:32,464 --> 02:38:36,426
So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion.

1382
02:39:03,954 --> 02:39:05,789
Drive them to the river!

1383
02:39:08,500 --> 02:39:10,502
Make safe the city!

1384
02:39:50,500 --> 02:39:52,502
Re-form the line!

1385
02:39:53,628 --> 02:39:55,547
Re-form the line!

1386
02:40:02,554 --> 02:40:05,181
Sound the charge! Take them head-on!

1387
02:40:05,849 --> 02:40:08,018
Charge!

1388
02:41:26,930 --> 02:41:28,348
Cut him down!

1389
02:41:30,100 --> 02:41:32,060
Follow me!

1390
02:41:54,999 --> 02:41:57,627
Take the reins. Pull him left!

1391
02:42:00,004 --> 02:42:01,297
Left!

1392
02:42:18,690 --> 02:42:20,400
Aim for their heads!

1393
02:42:26,406 --> 02:42:29,659
Bring it down! Bring it down!
Bring it down!

1394
02:42:43,506 --> 02:42:45,008
Merry!

1395
02:43:58,414 --> 02:44:00,500
I didn't think it would end this way.

1396
02:44:01,751 --> 02:44:03,211
End?

1397
02:44:04,420 --> 02:44:06,589
No, the journey doesn't end here.

1398
02:44:09,092 --> 02:44:12,220
Death is just another path...

1399
02:44:12,762 --> 02:44:14,430
...one that we all must take.

1400
02:44:15,723 --> 02:44:19,143
The Grey rain curtain
of this world rolls back...

1401
02:44:19,310 --> 02:44:22,939
...and all turns to silver glass.

1402
02:44:25,108 --> 02:44:27,110
And then you see it.

1403
02:44:29,028 --> 02:44:31,406
What, Gandalf?

1404
02:44:32,532 --> 02:44:33,825
See what?

1405
02:44:35,118 --> 02:44:37,287
White shores...

1406
02:44:38,955 --> 02:44:41,416
...and beyond.

1407
02:44:42,834 --> 02:44:44,627
A far green country...

1408
02:44:45,336 --> 02:44:48,298
...under a swift sunrise.

1409
02:44:52,302 --> 02:44:53,803
Well...

1410
02:44:53,970 --> 02:44:55,638
...that isn't so bad.

1411
02:44:55,805 --> 02:44:57,265
No.

1412
02:44:59,309 --> 02:45:00,977
No, it isn't.

1413
02:45:17,327 --> 02:45:20,663
Rally to me! To me!

1414
02:45:41,476 --> 02:45:46,022
Feast on his flesh.

1415
02:45:50,360 --> 02:45:52,695
I will kill you if you touch him.

1416
02:45:52,862 --> 02:45:58,368
Do not come between
the Nazgûl and his prey.

1417
02:47:06,769 --> 02:47:09,939
Late as usual, pirate scum!

1418
02:47:10,398 --> 02:47:12,608
There's knife-work here needs doing.

1419
02:47:12,775 --> 02:47:15,987
Come on, you sea rats!
Get off your ships!

1420
02:47:31,461 --> 02:47:33,629
There's plenty for the both of us.

1421
02:47:33,796 --> 02:47:35,840
May the best Dwarf win.

1422
02:47:53,316 --> 02:47:55,526
You fool.

1423
02:47:55,735 --> 02:47:59,155
No man can kill me.

1424
02:48:01,491 --> 02:48:04,660
Die now.

1425
02:48:15,338 --> 02:48:17,340
I am no man.

1426
02:48:33,856 --> 02:48:37,360
- Fifteen! Sixteen!
- Seventeen!

1427
02:48:45,201 --> 02:48:47,078
Merry!

1428
02:49:29,078 --> 02:49:30,913
Legolas!

1429
02:49:53,269 --> 02:49:55,646
Thirty-three, thirty-four.

1430
02:50:42,777 --> 02:50:45,154
That still only counts as one!

1431
02:50:45,321 --> 02:50:47,490
Come on, then. Come on!

1432
02:51:31,200 --> 02:51:34,036
I know your face...

1433
02:51:35,871 --> 02:51:37,707
...Éowyn.

1434
02:51:40,334 --> 02:51:42,712
My eyes darken.

1435
02:51:43,838 --> 02:51:45,214
No.

1436
02:51:46,048 --> 02:51:47,675
No.

1437
02:51:49,719 --> 02:51:52,221
I am going to save you.

1438
02:51:53,556 --> 02:51:55,891
You already did.

1439
02:51:59,562 --> 02:52:01,230
Éowyn...

1440
02:52:02,732 --> 02:52:05,234
...my body is broken.

1441
02:52:10,239 --> 02:52:12,742
You have to let me go.

1442
02:52:18,581 --> 02:52:21,208
I go to my fathers...

1443
02:52:22,626 --> 02:52:25,504
...in whose mighty company...

1444
02:52:25,921 --> 02:52:29,258
...I shall not now feel ashamed.

1445
02:52:45,900 --> 02:52:47,526
Éowyn.

1446
02:53:33,989 --> 02:53:36,492
Release us.

1447
02:53:38,369 --> 02:53:40,120
Bad idea.

1448
02:53:40,287 --> 02:53:44,124
Very handy in a tight spot, these lads,
despite the fact they're dead.

1449
02:53:44,291 --> 02:53:46,293
You gave us your word.

1450
02:53:48,003 --> 02:53:50,172
I hold your oath fulfilled.

1451
02:53:51,507 --> 02:53:52,842
Go.

1452
02:53:53,676 --> 02:53:55,344
Be at peace.

1453
02:54:38,721 --> 02:54:40,639
Merry.

1454
02:54:41,223 --> 02:54:44,393
No!

1455
02:54:48,355 --> 02:54:50,733
No!

1456
02:56:37,840 --> 02:56:39,049
Merry!

1457
02:56:40,676 --> 02:56:42,678
Merry!

1458
02:56:54,023 --> 02:56:55,858
Merry.

1459
02:56:58,360 --> 02:56:59,570
Merry, it's me.

1460
02:57:02,197 --> 02:57:03,782
It's Pippin.

1461
02:57:06,285 --> 02:57:08,537
I knew you'd find me.

1462
02:57:08,704 --> 02:57:09,913
Yes.

1463
02:57:12,374 --> 02:57:14,418
Are you going to leave me?

1464
02:57:15,002 --> 02:57:16,712
No, Merry.

1465
02:57:18,005 --> 02:57:20,215
I'm going to look after you.

1466
02:58:04,259 --> 02:58:05,636
Hands off!

1467
02:58:05,844 --> 02:58:08,972
That shiny shirt, that's mine.

1468
02:58:09,264 --> 02:58:13,435
It's going to the Great Eye,
along with everything else.

1469
02:58:14,937 --> 02:58:18,774
I don't take orders from
stinking Morgul-rats!

1470
02:58:19,608 --> 02:58:24,780
You touch it, and I'll stick
this blade in your gut.

1471
02:58:45,467 --> 02:58:47,302
The scum tried to knife me.

1472
02:58:47,469 --> 02:58:49,179
Kill him!

1473
03:00:32,407 --> 03:00:34,409
That's for Frodo!

1474
03:00:34,785 --> 03:00:36,912
And for the Shire!

1475
03:00:40,540 --> 03:00:42,626
And that's for my old Gaffer!

1476
03:01:12,114 --> 03:01:15,450
Stop your squealing, you dunghill rat.

1477
03:01:16,618 --> 03:01:21,290
I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig.

1478
03:01:28,630 --> 03:01:31,300
- Not if I stick you first.
- Sam!

1479
03:01:37,097 --> 03:01:39,141
Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.

1480
03:01:39,308 --> 03:01:41,310
Sorry for everything.

1481
03:01:41,810 --> 03:01:45,480
- Let's get you out of here.
- It's too late. It's over.

1482
03:01:45,647 --> 03:01:48,567
They've taken it. Sam...

1483
03:01:49,318 --> 03:01:50,819
...they took the Ring.

1484
03:01:51,611 --> 03:01:54,323
Begging your pardon, but they haven't.

1485
03:02:06,293 --> 03:02:08,503
I thought I'd lost you.

1486
03:02:08,837 --> 03:02:10,589
So I took it.

1487
03:02:11,715 --> 03:02:13,842
Only for safekeeping.

1488
03:02:15,093 --> 03:02:16,845
Give it to me.

1489
03:02:20,349 --> 03:02:22,601
Give me the Ring, Sam.

1490
03:02:27,230 --> 03:02:28,523
Sam.

1491
03:02:30,108 --> 03:02:32,027
Give me the Ring.

1492
03:02:52,756 --> 03:02:54,758
You must understand.

1493
03:02:57,552 --> 03:02:59,388
The Ring is my burden.

1494
03:03:00,555 --> 03:03:02,724
It will destroy you, Sam.

1495
03:03:05,894 --> 03:03:07,896
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

1496
03:03:09,231 --> 03:03:10,857
We best find you some clothes.

1497
03:03:11,024 --> 03:03:14,069
You can't go walking through Mordor
in naught but your skin.

1498
03:03:35,757 --> 03:03:37,968
We did it, Mr. Frodo.

1499
03:03:38,468 --> 03:03:40,762
We made it to Mordor.

1500
03:03:42,097 --> 03:03:43,765
There are so many of them.

1501
03:03:44,766 --> 03:03:47,310
We'll never get through unseen.

1502
03:03:52,441 --> 03:03:55,777
It's him, the Eye.

1503
03:04:03,493 --> 03:04:06,121
We have to go in there, Mr. Frodo.

1504
03:04:06,621 --> 03:04:08,623
There's nothing for it.

1505
03:04:11,626 --> 03:04:16,089
Come on. Let's just make it
down the hill for starters.

1506
03:04:25,432 --> 03:04:28,643
Frodo has passed beyond my sight.

1507
03:04:29,978 --> 03:04:32,814
The darkness is deepening.

1508
03:04:32,981 --> 03:04:35,358
If Sauron had the Ring,
we would know it.

1509
03:04:35,525 --> 03:04:37,611
It's only a matter of time.

1510
03:04:39,112 --> 03:04:41,490
He has suffered a defeat, yes...

1511
03:04:42,532 --> 03:04:47,037
...but behind the walls of Mordor,
our enemy is regrouping.

1512
03:04:47,245 --> 03:04:49,039
Let him stay there.

1513
03:04:49,247 --> 03:04:51,875
Let him rot! Why should we care?

1514
03:04:52,042 --> 03:04:57,255
Because 10,000 Orcs now stand
between Frodo and Mount Doom.

1515
03:05:04,012 --> 03:05:06,765
I've sent him to his death.

1516
03:05:08,266 --> 03:05:09,309
No.

1517
03:05:10,560 --> 03:05:12,270
There is still hope for Frodo.

1518
03:05:12,562 --> 03:05:16,691
He needs time and safe passage
across the plains of Gorgoroth.

1519
03:05:17,817 --> 03:05:20,362
- We can give him that.
- How?

1520
03:05:20,695 --> 03:05:23,406
Draw out Sauron's armies.

1521
03:05:23,573 --> 03:05:25,700
Empty his lands.

1522
03:05:25,909 --> 03:05:29,037
Then we gather our full strength
and march on the Black Gate.

1523
03:05:30,664 --> 03:05:32,916
We cannot achieve victory
through strength of arms.

1524
03:05:33,083 --> 03:05:34,376
Not for ourselves.

1525
03:05:34,584 --> 03:05:40,215
But we can give Frodo his chance
if we keep Sauron's Eye fixed upon us.

1526
03:05:42,008 --> 03:05:45,804
Keep him blind to all else that moves.

1527
03:05:46,555 --> 03:05:47,722
A diversion.

1528
03:05:47,889 --> 03:05:49,724
Certainty of death...

1529
03:05:49,891 --> 03:05:52,602
...small chance of success...

1530
03:05:53,520 --> 03:05:55,063
...what are we waiting for?

1531
03:05:55,689 --> 03:05:58,066
Sauron will suspect a trap.

1532
03:05:58,900 --> 03:06:00,902
He will not take the bait.

1533
03:06:02,404 --> 03:06:04,906
Oh, I think he will.

1534
03:06:39,357 --> 03:06:41,943
Long have you hunted me.

1535
03:06:42,861 --> 03:06:44,112
Long have I eluded you.

1536
03:06:45,947 --> 03:06:47,574
No more.

1537
03:06:49,284 --> 03:06:51,661
Behold the Sword of Elendil.

1538
03:07:36,164 --> 03:07:38,667
The city has fallen silent.

1539
03:07:40,335 --> 03:07:43,421
There is no warmth left in the sun.

1540
03:07:44,172 --> 03:07:45,924
It grows so cold.

1541
03:07:48,927 --> 03:07:51,971
It's just the damp
of the first spring rain.

1542
03:07:58,353 --> 03:08:01,523
I do not believe this darkness
will endure.

1543
03:08:30,218 --> 03:08:31,720
Look, the Orcs...

1544
03:08:32,262 --> 03:08:34,264
...they're moving off.

1545
03:08:35,348 --> 03:08:37,392
You see, Mr. Frodo...

1546
03:08:37,559 --> 03:08:39,894
...some luck at last.

1547
03:08:40,061 --> 03:08:41,896
Move it, you slugs!

1548
03:08:43,231 --> 03:08:46,568
Come on! Faster!

1549
03:08:54,576 --> 03:08:57,871
Come along, you scum...

1550
03:08:58,037 --> 03:09:02,250
I'll whip you down to the bone, you...

1551
03:09:05,128 --> 03:09:06,755
Come on!

1552
03:09:06,921 --> 03:09:09,257
What have I told you?!

1553
03:09:16,097 --> 03:09:17,599
Get up!

1554
03:09:18,016 --> 03:09:20,643
Come on, you slugs!

1555
03:09:20,810 --> 03:09:24,439
You two are going straight
to the front line!

1556
03:09:24,606 --> 03:09:29,569
Now, move it! Go on!
Fall in! Move it!

1557
03:09:42,540 --> 03:09:46,336
To the Gate, you slugs!
Now, move it!

1558
03:09:55,762 --> 03:09:59,307
Don't you know we're at war?

1559
03:10:21,663 --> 03:10:24,499
Company, halt!

1560
03:10:28,336 --> 03:10:31,714
Inspection!

1561
03:10:31,881 --> 03:10:34,342
Sam, help me.

1562
03:10:34,509 --> 03:10:36,344
Mr. Frodo!

1563
03:10:39,097 --> 03:10:41,641
Stand up, Mr. Frodo.
Stand up!

1564
03:10:41,808 --> 03:10:43,643
It's so heavy.

1565
03:10:52,735 --> 03:10:53,903
Oh, no.

1566
03:10:59,534 --> 03:11:01,536
What do I do?
What do we do?

1567
03:11:04,414 --> 03:11:05,748
- Hit me.
- What?

1568
03:11:05,915 --> 03:11:08,001
Hit me, Sam. Start fighting.

1569
03:11:08,167 --> 03:11:09,711
Get off of me!

1570
03:11:10,378 --> 03:11:12,714
Nobody pushes me, you filthy maggot.

1571
03:11:21,389 --> 03:11:23,391
Get off of me!

1572
03:11:24,350 --> 03:11:26,227
Break it up! Break it up!

1573
03:11:28,771 --> 03:11:33,359
Oi! I'll have your guts if you don't
shut this rabble down!

1574
03:11:33,568 --> 03:11:35,904
Go, Sam. Now!

1575
03:11:44,787 --> 03:11:46,372
Move along, scum!

1576
03:11:46,539 --> 03:11:48,416
Back in the line!

1577
03:11:48,917 --> 03:11:50,752
You maggots!

1578
03:11:51,419 --> 03:11:54,422
Get back into the line,
you slugs!

1579
03:11:56,799 --> 03:12:00,261
Dig it, you slugs. Move it.

1580
03:12:02,972 --> 03:12:04,933
Move it!

1581
03:12:49,102 --> 03:12:51,145
I can't...

1582
03:12:51,312 --> 03:12:55,024
I can't...
I can't manage the Ring, Sam.

1583
03:12:55,274 --> 03:12:56,359
It's... It's...

1584
03:12:56,526 --> 03:12:59,153
It's such a weight to carry.

1585
03:12:59,988 --> 03:13:01,030
It...

1586
03:13:01,239 --> 03:13:03,157
Such a weight.

1587
03:13:08,162 --> 03:13:10,623
We're going that way.
Straight as we can.

1588
03:13:12,041 --> 03:13:15,169
There's no point carrying anything
we're not sure to need.

1589
03:13:30,351 --> 03:13:32,186
Mr. Frodo.

1590
03:13:33,688 --> 03:13:35,189
Look.

1591
03:13:37,817 --> 03:13:39,652
There is light...

1592
03:13:39,986 --> 03:13:42,363
...and beauty up there...

1593
03:13:42,530 --> 03:13:44,282
...that no shadow can touch.

1594
03:14:35,333 --> 03:14:36,918
Take mine.

1595
03:14:37,418 --> 03:14:39,587
There's a few drops left.

1596
03:14:54,769 --> 03:14:57,396
There will be none left
for the return journey.

1597
03:14:58,272 --> 03:15:01,442
I don't think there will be
a return journey, Mr. Frodo.

1598
03:15:54,328 --> 03:15:56,497
Frodo, get down!

1599
03:15:58,291 --> 03:16:00,168
Hide!

1600
03:16:10,553 --> 03:16:12,346
Frodo!

1601
03:16:18,186 --> 03:16:19,645
Where are they?

1602
03:16:55,723 --> 03:16:58,726
Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth!

1603
03:16:59,685 --> 03:17:02,521
Let justice be done upon him!

1604
03:17:46,023 --> 03:17:49,944
My master, Sauron the Great,
bids thee welcome.

1605
03:17:55,783 --> 03:17:59,537
Is there any in this rout
with authority to treat with me?

1606
03:17:59,912 --> 03:18:02,999
We do not come to treat with Sauron...

1607
03:18:03,165 --> 03:18:06,127
...faithless and accursed.

1608
03:18:06,294 --> 03:18:09,755
Tell your master this:
The armies of Mordor must disband.

1609
03:18:09,922 --> 03:18:12,591
He is to depart these lands,
never to return.

1610
03:18:12,800 --> 03:18:16,137
Aha. Old Greybeard.

1611
03:18:17,596 --> 03:18:21,851
I have a token I was bidden
to show thee.

1612
03:18:26,856 --> 03:18:28,190
Frodo.

1613
03:18:31,068 --> 03:18:32,486
Frodo.

1614
03:18:33,487 --> 03:18:34,697
- Silence.
- No!

1615
03:18:35,573 --> 03:18:36,866
Silence!

1616
03:18:38,659 --> 03:18:42,455
The Halfling was dear to thee, I see.

1617
03:18:43,456 --> 03:18:47,501
Know that he suffered greatly
at the hands of his host.

1618
03:18:53,007 --> 03:18:58,804
Who would've thought one so small
could endure so much pain?

1619
03:19:01,390 --> 03:19:03,517
And he did, Gandalf.

1620
03:19:03,684 --> 03:19:05,478
He did.

1621
03:19:12,485 --> 03:19:13,986
And who is this?

1622
03:19:14,153 --> 03:19:16,197
Isildur's heir?

1623
03:19:16,364 --> 03:19:19,367
It takes more to make a king
than a broken Elvish blade.

1624
03:19:24,163 --> 03:19:26,707
I guess that concludes negotiations.

1625
03:19:28,876 --> 03:19:30,044
I do not believe it.

1626
03:19:32,046 --> 03:19:33,339
I will not.

1627
03:19:49,563 --> 03:19:51,357
Pull back.

1628
03:19:51,649 --> 03:19:53,692
Pull back!

1629
03:20:05,913 --> 03:20:07,915
It's gone, Mr. Frodo.

1630
03:20:10,418 --> 03:20:13,421
The light's passed on,
away towards the north.

1631
03:20:13,587 --> 03:20:15,423
Something's drawn its gaze.

1632
03:20:32,940 --> 03:20:35,693
Hold your ground! Hold your ground.

1633
03:20:37,778 --> 03:20:41,782
Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers!

1634
03:20:44,618 --> 03:20:46,495
I see in your eyes...

1635
03:20:46,912 --> 03:20:50,958
...the same fear that would take
the heart of me.

1636
03:20:52,918 --> 03:20:56,797
A day may come
when the courage of Men fails...

1637
03:20:56,964 --> 03:21:00,301
...when we forsake our friends
and break all bonds of fellowship.

1638
03:21:00,468 --> 03:21:03,137
But it is not this day.

1639
03:21:03,429 --> 03:21:06,474
An hour of wolves
and shattered shields...

1640
03:21:06,640 --> 03:21:09,477
...when the age of Men
comes crashing down.

1641
03:21:09,643 --> 03:21:12,146
But it is not this day.

1642
03:21:12,313 --> 03:21:13,981
This day we fight!

1643
03:21:16,442 --> 03:21:20,112
By all that you hold dear
on this good earth...

1644
03:21:20,279 --> 03:21:24,492
...I bid you stand, Men of the West!

1645
03:22:52,955 --> 03:22:56,542
Never thought I'd die fighting
side by side with an Elf.

1646
03:22:56,959 --> 03:22:59,336
What about side by side with a friend?

1647
03:23:02,881 --> 03:23:04,592
Aye.

1648
03:23:05,426 --> 03:23:07,219
I could do that.

1649
03:23:37,583 --> 03:23:39,627
Do you remember the Shire,
Mr. Frodo?

1650
03:23:42,630 --> 03:23:44,882
It'll be spring soon.

1651
03:23:45,633 --> 03:23:48,344
And the orchards will be in blossom.

1652
03:23:48,510 --> 03:23:52,181
And the birds will be nesting
in the hazel thicket.

1653
03:23:53,599 --> 03:23:57,603
And they'll be sowing
the summer barley in the lower fields...

1654
03:23:58,646 --> 03:24:02,983
...and eating the first
of the strawberries with cream.

1655
03:24:04,943 --> 03:24:07,446
Do you remember
the taste of strawberries?

1656
03:24:08,989 --> 03:24:10,699
No, Sam.

1657
03:24:10,908 --> 03:24:13,827
I can't recall the taste of food...

1658
03:24:14,995 --> 03:24:18,290
...nor the sound of water...

1659
03:24:18,457 --> 03:24:22,002
...nor the touch of grass.

1660
03:24:23,003 --> 03:24:24,505
I'm...

1661
03:24:25,422 --> 03:24:26,799
...naked in the dark.

1662
03:24:28,467 --> 03:24:30,719
There's-- There's nothing.

1663
03:24:30,928 --> 03:24:35,641
No veil between me
and the wheel of fire.

1664
03:24:36,850 --> 03:24:38,811
I can see him...

1665
03:24:39,186 --> 03:24:40,854
...with my waking eyes.

1666
03:24:41,939 --> 03:24:44,358
Then let us be rid of it...

1667
03:24:44,983 --> 03:24:47,194
...once and for all.

1668
03:24:47,945 --> 03:24:50,030
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

1669
03:24:50,197 --> 03:24:52,825
I can't carry it for you...

1670
03:24:53,200 --> 03:24:55,244
...but I can carry you.

1671
03:24:55,828 --> 03:24:57,538
Come on!

1672
03:25:27,985 --> 03:25:30,904
<i>Aragorn.</i>

1673
03:25:42,499 --> 03:25:45,085
<i>Elessar.</i>

1674
03:25:57,097 --> 03:25:59,516
For Frodo.

1675
03:26:34,468 --> 03:26:35,969
Look, Mr. Frodo.

1676
03:26:36,637 --> 03:26:38,847
A doorway.

1677
03:26:39,473 --> 03:26:41,141
We're almost there.

1678
03:26:43,477 --> 03:26:47,439
Clever Hobbits to climb so high!

1679
03:27:01,328 --> 03:27:02,996
Mustn't go that way.

1680
03:27:04,581 --> 03:27:07,000
Mustn't hurt the precious.

1681
03:27:07,167 --> 03:27:08,961
You swore!

1682
03:27:09,127 --> 03:27:11,171
You swore on the precious!

1683
03:27:13,090 --> 03:27:15,008
Sméagol promised!

1684
03:27:15,968 --> 03:27:17,970
Sméagol lied.

1685
03:28:10,439 --> 03:28:12,357
Frodo!

1686
03:28:39,426 --> 03:28:41,219
Eagles.

1687
03:28:42,596 --> 03:28:44,097
The eagles are coming!

1688
03:29:06,954 --> 03:29:08,789
Frodo!

1689
03:29:14,086 --> 03:29:15,337
I'm here, Sam.

1690
03:29:22,803 --> 03:29:24,471
Destroy it!

1691
03:29:34,982 --> 03:29:38,318
Go on! Now!

1692
03:29:38,485 --> 03:29:40,988
Throw it in the fire!

1693
03:29:54,376 --> 03:29:57,045
What are you waiting for?

1694
03:29:58,964 --> 03:30:01,341
Just let it go!

1695
03:30:34,541 --> 03:30:36,793
The Ring is mine.

1696
03:30:40,338 --> 03:30:42,049
No.

1697
03:30:42,507 --> 03:30:43,800
No.

1698
03:30:52,225 --> 03:30:54,895
No!

1699
03:32:39,332 --> 03:32:41,168
Yes!

1700
03:32:42,335 --> 03:32:44,045
Yes!

1701
03:32:45,172 --> 03:32:48,049
Precious! Precious!

1702
03:32:48,216 --> 03:32:51,052
Precious! Precious!

1703
03:33:44,356 --> 03:33:46,191
Give me your hand!

1704
03:33:54,532 --> 03:33:56,910
Take my hand!

1705
03:33:59,579 --> 03:34:00,914
No!

1706
03:34:08,213 --> 03:34:10,131
Don't you let go.

1707
03:34:14,761 --> 03:34:16,304
Don't let go.

1708
03:34:17,931 --> 03:34:19,432
Reach!

1709
03:35:48,605 --> 03:35:51,483
Frodo!

1710
03:35:52,025 --> 03:35:55,028
Frodo!

1711
03:37:16,443 --> 03:37:18,278
It's gone.

1712
03:37:22,740 --> 03:37:24,451
It's done.

1713
03:37:24,951 --> 03:37:26,953
Yes, Mr. Frodo.

1714
03:37:28,329 --> 03:37:30,790
It's over now.

1715
03:37:56,441 --> 03:37:58,818
I can see the Shire.

1716
03:38:00,987 --> 03:38:03,323
The Brandywine River.

1717
03:38:05,492 --> 03:38:07,494
Bag End.

1718
03:38:09,829 --> 03:38:12,499
Gandalf's fireworks.

1719
03:38:12,957 --> 03:38:16,669
The lights in the Party Tree.

1720
03:38:18,171 --> 03:38:21,341
Rosie Cotton dancing.

1721
03:38:22,467 --> 03:38:25,178
She had ribbons in her hair.

1722
03:38:28,056 --> 03:38:31,017
If ever I was to marry someone...

1723
03:38:31,976 --> 03:38:34,187
...it would've been her.

1724
03:38:35,647 --> 03:38:37,690
It would've been her.

1725
03:38:49,869 --> 03:38:53,039
I'm glad to be with you,
Samwise Gamgee...

1726
03:38:57,377 --> 03:39:00,296
...here at the end of all things.

1727
03:40:49,989 --> 03:40:51,991
Gandalf?

1728
03:41:11,678 --> 03:41:13,680
Frodo!

1729
03:41:33,449 --> 03:41:35,243
Gimli!

1730
03:43:18,262 --> 03:43:21,974
Now come the days of the king.

1731
03:43:26,979 --> 03:43:29,315
May they be blessed.

1732
03:43:49,627 --> 03:43:52,296
This day does not belong to one man...

1733
03:43:52,463 --> 03:43:54,340
...but to all.

1734
03:43:56,008 --> 03:43:58,886
Let us together rebuild this world...

1735
03:43:59,095 --> 03:44:03,349
...that we may share
in the days of peace.

1736
03:46:37,837 --> 03:46:39,880
My friends...

1737
03:46:45,177 --> 03:46:47,847
...you bow to no one.

1738
03:47:32,058 --> 03:47:34,185
<i>And thus it was.</i>

1739
03:47:34,351 --> 03:47:37,938
<i>A Fourth Age of Middle-earth began.</i>

1740
03:47:38,105 --> 03:47:40,691
<i>And the Fellowship of the Ring...</i>

1741
03:47:40,858 --> 03:47:45,362
<i>...though eternally bound
by friendship and love...</i>

1742
03:47:45,529 --> 03:47:47,907
<i>...was ended.</i>

1743
03:47:52,912 --> 03:47:57,750
<i>Thirteen months to the day since Gandalf
sent us on our long journey...</i>

1744
03:47:57,917 --> 03:48:02,088
<i>...we found ourselves
looking upon a familiar sight.</i>

1745
03:48:04,632 --> 03:48:07,384
<i>We were home.</i>

1746
03:48:13,933 --> 03:48:15,768
Hi.

1747
03:48:32,952 --> 03:48:35,162
Hey, watch the pumpkin.

1748
03:48:42,878 --> 03:48:44,505
Hey!

1749
03:49:23,169 --> 03:49:24,837
More of the same, Rosie.

1750
03:49:25,004 --> 03:49:27,006
Good night, lads.

1751
03:50:11,550 --> 03:50:13,010
Hm?

1752
03:50:24,563 --> 03:50:28,567
<i>How do you pick up the threads
of an old life?</i>

1753
03:50:29,902 --> 03:50:32,112
<i>How do you go on...</i>

1754
03:50:32,279 --> 03:50:37,534
<i>...when in your heart
you begin to understand...</i>

1755
03:50:38,744 --> 03:50:41,747
<i>...there is no going back?</i>

1756
03:50:42,414 --> 03:50:46,085
<i>There are some things
that time cannot mend...</i>

1757
03:50:46,585 --> 03:50:49,546
<i>...some hurts that go too deep...</i>

1758
03:50:51,257 --> 03:50:54,093
<i>...that have taken hold.</i>

1759
03:51:32,298 --> 03:51:34,133
Mr. Frodo?

1760
03:51:37,469 --> 03:51:38,846
What is it?

1761
03:51:40,681 --> 03:51:44,643
It's been four years to the day
since Weathertop, Sam.

1762
03:51:45,311 --> 03:51:48,063
It's never really healed.

1763
03:51:51,984 --> 03:51:57,281
<i>"There and Back Again: A Hobbit's Tale</i>
by Bilbo Baggins.

1764
03:51:57,990 --> 03:52:01,827
And <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>
by Frodo Baggins."

1765
03:52:02,328 --> 03:52:04,496
You finished it.

1766
03:52:07,333 --> 03:52:08,834
Not quite.

1767
03:52:09,668 --> 03:52:12,171
There's room for a little more.

1768
03:52:14,840 --> 03:52:19,053
<i>Bilbo once told me his part
in this tale would end...</i>

1769
03:52:19,219 --> 03:52:22,514
<i>...that each of us must come and go
in the telling.</i>

1770
03:52:23,390 --> 03:52:26,226
<i>Bilbo's story was now over.</i>

1771
03:52:26,727 --> 03:52:29,688
<i>There would be no more journeys
for him...</i>

1772
03:52:29,855 --> 03:52:31,357
<i>...save one.</i>

1773
03:52:32,149 --> 03:52:35,694
Tell me again, lad, where are we going?

1774
03:52:35,861 --> 03:52:37,863
To the harbor, Bilbo.

1775
03:52:38,030 --> 03:52:40,741
The Elves have accorded you
a special honor...

1776
03:52:40,908 --> 03:52:43,535
...a place on the last ship
to leave Middle-earth.

1777
03:52:45,245 --> 03:52:46,914
Frodo...

1778
03:52:48,374 --> 03:52:52,878
...any chance of seeing
that old Ring of mine again?

1779
03:52:53,545 --> 03:52:55,756
The one I gave you.

1780
03:52:59,385 --> 03:53:01,553
I'm sorry, Uncle.

1781
03:53:04,139 --> 03:53:06,725
I'm afraid I lost it.

1782
03:53:06,892 --> 03:53:08,727
Oh.

1783
03:53:09,353 --> 03:53:10,771
Pity.

1784
03:53:13,565 --> 03:53:17,403
I should like to have held it
one last time.

1785
03:53:42,386 --> 03:53:44,054
Oh!

1786
03:53:46,598 --> 03:53:51,603
Well, here's a sight
I have never seen before.

1787
03:54:05,784 --> 03:54:09,121
The power of the Three Rings is ended.

1788
03:54:09,955 --> 03:54:12,749
The time has come...

1789
03:54:12,916 --> 03:54:16,211
...for the dominion of Men.

1790
03:54:17,212 --> 03:54:20,132
The sea calls us home.

1791
03:54:28,599 --> 03:54:30,767
I think I'm...

1792
03:54:30,934 --> 03:54:35,314
...quite ready
for another adventure.

1793
03:55:06,345 --> 03:55:08,680
Farewell...

1794
03:55:08,847 --> 03:55:11,558
...my brave Hobbits.

1795
03:55:13,519 --> 03:55:15,521
My work is now finished.

1796
03:55:19,483 --> 03:55:24,363
Here at last,
on the shores of the sea...

1797
03:55:25,030 --> 03:55:27,866
...comes the end of our Fellowship.

1798
03:55:31,370 --> 03:55:33,872
I will not say, "Do not weep"...

1799
03:55:34,540 --> 03:55:38,544
...for not all tears are an evil.

1800
03:55:56,103 --> 03:55:58,063
It is time, Frodo.

1801
03:56:03,569 --> 03:56:05,571
What does he mean?

1802
03:56:08,073 --> 03:56:10,909
We set out to save the Shire, Sam.

1803
03:56:12,536 --> 03:56:15,247
And it has been saved.

1804
03:56:18,917 --> 03:56:21,587
But not for me.

1805
03:56:22,546 --> 03:56:24,965
You don't mean that.

1806
03:56:26,216 --> 03:56:28,260
You can't leave.

1807
03:56:36,768 --> 03:56:39,438
The last pages are for you, Sam.

1808
04:00:12,567 --> 04:00:15,445
<i>My dear Sam:</i>

1809
04:00:17,322 --> 04:00:20,659
<i>You cannot always be torn in two.</i>

1810
04:00:20,826 --> 04:00:24,996
<i>You will have to be one and whole
for many years.</i>

1811
04:00:25,705 --> 04:00:31,169
<i>You have so much to enjoy
and to be and to do.</i>

1812
04:00:32,462 --> 04:00:35,632
<i>Your part in the story will go on.</i>

1813
04:00:36,341 --> 04:00:38,134
Well...

1814
04:00:40,011 --> 04:00:41,680
...I'm back.

1815
04:02:24,282 --> 04:02:28,286
<i>Lay down</i>

1816
04:02:29,913 --> 04:02:34,292
<i>Your sweet and weary head</i>

1817
04:02:36,002 --> 04:02:39,631
<i>Night is falling</i>

1818
04:02:40,298 --> 04:02:45,136
<i>You have come
To journey's end</i>

1819
04:02:45,804 --> 04:02:49,516
<i>Sleep now</i>

1820
04:02:49,724 --> 04:02:55,355
<i>And dream
Of the ones who came before</i>

1821
04:02:57,148 --> 04:03:01,027
<i>They are calling</i>

1822
04:03:01,236 --> 04:03:05,323
<i>From across
The distant shore</i>

1823
04:03:06,950 --> 04:03:11,830
<i>Why do you weep?</i>

1824
04:03:11,997 --> 04:03:17,002
<i>What are these tears
Upon your face?</i>

1825
04:03:17,168 --> 04:03:22,215
<i>Soon you will see</i>

1826
04:03:22,382 --> 04:03:27,345
<i>All of your fears
Will pass away</i>

1827
04:03:27,512 --> 04:03:32,642
<i>Safe in my arms</i>

1828
04:03:32,809 --> 04:03:37,313
<i>You're only sleeping</i>

1829
04:03:37,480 --> 04:03:42,485
<i>What can you see</i>

1830
04:03:42,652 --> 04:03:47,866
<i>On the horizon?</i>

1831
04:03:48,033 --> 04:03:52,537
<i>Why do the white gulls</i>

1832
04:03:52,704 --> 04:03:57,417
<i>Call?</i>

1833
04:03:58,585 --> 04:04:03,214
<i>Across the sea</i>

1834
04:04:03,381 --> 04:04:08,678
<i>A pale moon rises</i>

1835
04:04:08,845 --> 04:04:11,556
<i>The ships have come</i>

1836
04:04:11,723 --> 04:04:17,520
<i>To carry you home</i>

1837
04:04:19,731 --> 04:04:24,277
<i>And all will turn</i>

1838
04:04:24,444 --> 04:04:29,783
<i>To silver glass</i>

1839
04:04:29,949 --> 04:04:34,245
<i>A light on the water</i>

1840
04:04:34,412 --> 04:04:39,918
<i>All souls pass</i>

1841
04:04:40,085 --> 04:04:44,255
<i>Hope fades</i>

1842
04:04:45,840 --> 04:04:50,762
<i>Into the world of night</i>

1843
04:04:51,429 --> 04:04:55,266
<i>Through shadows falling</i>

1844
04:04:56,101 --> 04:05:01,272
<i>Out of memory and time</i>

1845
04:05:01,940 --> 04:05:05,652
<i>Don't say</i>

1846
04:05:06,444 --> 04:05:11,449
<i>We have come now to the end</i>

1847
04:05:12,283 --> 04:05:16,746
<i>White shores are calling</i>

1848
04:05:16,913 --> 04:05:20,458
<i>You and I will meet again</i>

1849
04:05:20,625 --> 04:05:27,090
<i>And you'll be here
In my arms</i>

1850
04:05:28,299 --> 04:05:32,345
<i>Just sleeping</i>

1851
04:05:32,512 --> 04:05:37,350
<i>What can you see</i>

1852
04:05:37,517 --> 04:05:42,480
<i>On the horizon?</i>

1853
04:05:42,647 --> 04:05:47,485
<i>Why do the white gulls</i>

1854
04:05:47,652 --> 04:05:53,032
<i>Call?</i>

1855
04:05:53,199 --> 04:05:58,329
<i>Across the sea</i>

1856
04:05:58,496 --> 04:06:03,501
<i>A pale moon rises</i>

1857
04:06:03,668 --> 04:06:06,462
<i>The ships have come</i>

1858
04:06:06,629 --> 04:06:12,969
<i>To carry you home</i>

1859
04:06:14,179 --> 04:06:19,309
<i>And all will turn</i>

1860
04:06:19,851 --> 04:06:24,689
<i>To silver glass</i>

1861
04:06:24,856 --> 04:06:29,027
<i>A light on the water</i>

1862
04:06:29,194 --> 04:06:33,031
<i>Grey ships pass</i>

1863
04:06:33,198 --> 04:06:38,870
<i>Into the West</i>
