... So you don't need to go ... borrow equipment from anybody , to -- ... to do the feet ? ... Do the hooves ?  Well , we're gonna have to find somewhere , to get , ... something . .. So , Mae- -- I'm gonna -- Mae Lynne   We're not gonna do the feet today , I'm gonna wait till like , early in the morning , .. to do those , cause y- -- I mean you get so tired . ... n- you just , ... it takes -- well it takes me longer than most people , cause you know , I'm not as strong and , ... and I'm not as good , as like somebody that would do it .. all the time . .. You know . .. I mean , .. Oh -- I mean I trim horses and stuff like that , but I mean , I'm not like , .. I'm not uh ,  I don't know how to say it . But you know , they do it for a living . you know , ... most people that you would get to trim your horse do it .. all the time . ..  and I'm not ... that good or , .. and I'm not very strong . Did they train you- -- yeah . Did they train you that nan  yeah . ... yeah . .. So you have your own equipment ,  but , .. No . I don't have my own equipment at all . ... Dad , ... you know , has done some of it . That's another thing too , is I kinda had a b general idea , .. .. of kinda how to do it , just watching him . or -- and watching , .. people come to our place , and doing it and stuff you know .  .. and , ... ... I don't know . then , ... down there , um , it's mandatory . you have to -- to graduate , you know , or well , to get the degree , you know , .. you have to take this class . And you can only take- -- if you want to , you can only take it for eight weeks .  And , ... if you wanna go on in it , you n- -- then , you can go on . you know . .. And I decided to go ahead and go on in it . .. And the first part of it , .. is like , well we have lecture , .. then we have lab . .. And like , the first part of it , .. we just go into the classroom , and he like ,  .. In the beginning of the year there was a lot of classroom work . .. I mean , ... it- -- that's just kinda how it happens , you know , because he kinda has to tell you ,  ... they go over , .. the whole , ... the whole part .. of the horse . .. I mean , .. all the skeleton .. part of it you know , and- -- and they go through .. every kinda ligament . and I mean , there's , ... millions of ligaments , and millions of .. tendons , you know , well not millions , but , .. I mean , yeah , I bet .  and then , so we had to know these tendons , and ligaments , and then , all the bones , ... and , .. you know , all the way up- from the shoulder down , and then from the hip down . .. You know , all the way down to the hoof , and then , the bone in the hoof , and ,  .. then all the .. wall , and , you know , of the hoof , and , what everything was called there , and then , he went over on how to trim it , and where you- -- th- there's a white line , that you go by , and a horse .. has this little white line , and you clean it out with the -- ... with the hoof knife ? you know ? and then there- -- and then you can see this little white line ? and that's kinda where you go by , to -- .. you know , the horse kinda helps you out , because it , .. has that .. little white line right there . mhm . and that's where you kinda -- ... kinda need a little guide of where you trim . .. And , ... I am still scared to do it . because , you know , .. I mean , you can make a horse go lame , By doing it- really . Well you can trim em too short . ... And make em , you know , and they're just .. a little bit , for f- -- the first couple of days , you know , I mean they're just .. sore . That's not bad , but sometimes you can get it really bad . You can really make a horse really bad .  And they m- -- you know then , they have to , like , ... keep em , ... away from anything , you know , get em really in the soft ground , and , .. no .. hard pebbles or hard .. clods of dirt or anything ?  So nan , ... I don't know . I'm .. a little scared .. about doing it yet . you know , I get em really long . I mean they're still long . .. When I get done with them , A lot of times , like I'll get done , and I'll think I'm done and I'll look at- -- look down at the horse's hoof , .. and it's still , .. it's too .. long . ..  And then like , ... I would never , .. ever , .. ever trust myself , .. to shoe a horse . .. See we did that too . we did --  We did a lot of stuff . we did a lot of stuff with the -- like we had the , um , ... the burners ? you know , and you'd put the -- you'd have -- you started out with the straight .. iron ? .. you know ? and you'd stick it into the , .. into the , .. you know like , actual blackithing . .. And you'd put it into the hot .. coals , you know ? And then , we'd -- i- i- straight bar , and we'd make it a- -- a horseshoe out of it , you know ? .. But , -- these shoes we never did put on a horse . .. We just put the shoes that were already made ,   on a horse . .. And that's as far as we got . I mean , if you would really get into it , Well as a matter of fact , this is really funny . You know , there isn't .. really .. any girl farriers .. around anywhere . They're really -- farrier ? .. th- Yeah . farrier is what they're called . .. And the m- -- .. the reason they were showing us this at college , was just , .. to get us , to know if our trimmer , and shoer weres .. doing it right , and- -- plus the knowledge of knowing the bones and ligaments . which we , .. we had it in another class too . we -- that was kind of a double thing that , we had in- -- ... in another class , so it was kinda review for us . well it was a review for some people , depend on what time of the year you took it . You know . if it was a review or not . But , ... anyway um , ... what was I gonna say . .. I forgot what I was think- -- You said you never made the horseshoes , gonna say . but , ... Well , .. w- um , nan when we put em on a horse's hoof , all we do , they're already made . .. they're round . .. we pick out a size . .. you know we'd , like look at the horse's hoof , and say , okay , this is a doubleaught . this is an aught . .. this is , you know . .. what s- -- what size . .. and double-aught and aught , are the .. ones that are most popular .  ... For , ... you know , the light horse . You know , I mean , you get into the big horses , the -- like the Clydesdales , Shires , that's a d- -- a whole different thing . Or ponies , that's a whole different thing . But we're talking just the regular , .. light horses you know . .. And , aught and aught -- uh aught , and doubleaught , are the two sizes . .. Well anyway , you go get your -- .. Okay , this is after you trimmed em . .. And you go get your shoe , .. It's already made . It's already round . You pick out your size .  .. You go look , and every horse's hoof is shaped different . It doesn't matter . every horse is gonna have .. a little .. different shape . .. And so what you have to do , So every -- every uh , horseshoe is made -- custom-made for the horse then ? No no . .. No . What -- What we do , then that's .. that's where the ferrier comes in . .. Every shoe , is like , .. you get- order , you know , I would like a b- case of double-aught shoes . You'd get- -- .. The ferrier gets em . .. You know , that's the way it goes , .. And then , ... Our job , is to shape the shoe , .. to the horse's foot . ... And that , it d- it sounds easy , .. but it's really hard to do . .. I mean , some of em you have to , you know , like say , okay , say your shoe's like this ? .. and your horse's foot is just really wide or something ? .. Well then you have to put it on the anvil , and get the shoe stretched out , well then once you stretch the shoe out , .. well then , the two corners . they go out , too . .. you know , okay your shoe's like this ? You stretch this out , well then it's gonna make these go way out , too , and they get like this ? Right .  then you have to round these back , .. you know ? ... It's just , ... it s- it sounds easy , but it's really hard to do , and then , I would never do it , cause I'd never trust myself to do it . I mean we had to do it ,  but , it's just that people would volunteer their horses to the college , because ,  .. it costs like thirty bucks to get your horse shod . .. I mean , that's just how much it costs . Could you imagine all those horses out there , if we had em all shod ? that's -- How many have you got .  thirty bucks , for twenty horses- -- twenty . twen horses , you know ? I mean , ... Jesus , that would be a th- .. nine hundred dollars ,  just  like that . ... I mean , could you imagine ? So , ... w- you know , ... like , a lot of people , .. that have a lot of horses and stuff , .. and that they're riding a lot , they'll just , ... let the college kids do em . .. For em you know They're taking the risk , .. of having their horse ... get lame , but , .. It really never happens , cause we have our s- instructor right there , telling us , this is what you do . And it's not like , .. there's a person that's just gung ho , and goes and just ,  trims their feet , and puts the shoe on , you know , you d- you d- you can't do that . And so we have our instructor right there , and we asked a million questions , .. all the time I mean , he e- -- he just runs around . everywhere . .. you know . ... so it's -- .. .. But uh , ... What was I gonna say . ... Oh , and it's really tiring though . ... And it -- you know like , ... you get so- -- I've ... only done like , ... well , ... at the end of the year , now see , I took the second half of the course . .. And , .. right now , I've probably , .. only shod about , .. five horses . .. Trimmed a lot of em . And you know what we start out with ? This is the grossest of everything . What . We start out , .. with , .. dead horse hooves . ..  I mean , you know , the the canneries , you know and stuff you know ? .. The people that --  ... that -- .. kill the horses for meat and stuff ? .. You know they have all these legs and stuff ?  And -- .. I don't know , everybody None -- I thought they used the the horsehooves in .. for gelatin , That's not so ? ... You know , I think they do , I think a lot of times , but .. then they , .. they probably use em for everything- -- I don't know what all they use em for . But anyway , we .. get .. these horse hooves , from this one cannery , .. they -- they have to go , .. a long ways to go get em , like back East somewhere , to get these .. horse hooves . For the college . They go back .. East , and they get em . and they freeze em you know ? .. So we have this frozen horse hoof , that we have to start out on , cause you don't want to .. cripple up a .. really good horse , and like my first hoof , .. that horse would have been , .. lame ,   like crazy .   But , it was just , and , oh , God , it's so gross , because , .. sometimes if you get one that's been thawed out a little bit , .. they start really stinking and stuff ? Oh , it's the grossest thing . Oh , it's just so icky . I mean , you have this ... piece of horse  -- I mean this leg that's , oh , it's just gross . And like in some of em ? ... blood will spurt out , you know , and I mean , oh . It's nothing  --  it's the grossest thing  . And that's why -- ... that's probably why they have to make that class mandatory , because at the beginning of the year , it's just the -- it's the pits . But once you get into it , it's the funnest thing and , you know , it's really interesting , to do stuff like that . .. But , ... I would have never got into that class , if -- .. there's no way , if I didn't have to have it , there's no way . I mean , .. I heard everybody saying um- -- you know , like the people that took the class before , talking about , ... Oh , you have to do this , you have to do that , there's dead horse hooves , you know you gotta , and they stink , and all this other stuff , and I was just going , oh my God , I'm never -- I don't want to take that class . so maybe I'll wait till next year , and then I thought , no , I'll get it out of the way now .  And then once I got into it , geez , I wanna take the second half of it , it was just really interesting to me , you know ? .. But , .. at first it was kind of a bummer . ... But , I'm glad I took it . ... Really glad . ... It pays off . Especially , you know , .. twelve bucks , for a trim . ... I mean that's twelve bucks , every time I can go out , and trim my own horse's hooves . Right .  You know , and I wouldn't trust myself to do it , .. with , .. a horse that I was really using a lot , or anything , but the ones that are standing around , ... that's still twelve dollars , you know , I mean whether the horse being used a lot or not , that's twelve bucks . and ,  ... shoot , I can do those , you know ? ... But , I always have , anybody -- I always have somebody that really knows what they're doing for the horses that I'm really really using . ... But anyway , ... I wanna wait until the morning . .. to do that . .. because ,  It's just , ... too hot in the afternoon , to try to sit out there . I mean you can get , .. just , .. exhausted . Anyway , I was gonna tell you about that nan -- ... the girl , you know , there isn't mary- .. very many , .. ferrier girls you know ? And her heart , That do this ? This summer I met one . Jorgensen's , they have ... one .. shoer , that comes to their house , all the time , they've had him for years and years and years . And I guess like in Minnesota it's real wet , .. and stuff you know ? So like , .. they really have to watch their shoes , for not coming off , because the hoof wall , is so much softer . It's like , when you're down there , your hands are softer and everything you know , and they're not .. as dry or anything ? When you get back here , we have dry hooves . we have to watch out for like uh , ... like the hooves being too dry . we have to put ointment on em and stuff . The- -- Back there they're too wet . Not this time of the year , because , .. you know , they've had a dry year , but ,  usually they're too wet , and that- -- ... that shoe can just pull right off , because it's just , .. the hoof wall is so soft . ... Yeah . It seems weird , that that's like that ,  you know , and I nei- -- I never knew that , until I took this class , either . .. I didn't realize that in- -- you know , if you think about it , yeah , if it rains a lot , the horse is always wet ? And it's always moist , and it's always on something moist ? Yeah .   Sure it's gonna be softer . But I never even thought about that until I took this class . So it's -- you know that's .. kinda stuff too that you think about . But anyway , ... they always have this one horseshoer , and , this girl's been .. in this ferrier , ... uh , she's going to an actual .. ferrier college . They have a lot of those around . .. a lot . And she's going to one of em , and she's been going for , .. like nine months . .. to this one , and she's still got a lot more , Where is the , uh , .. left to go . ... What ? Where is the  . Oh . Right here . ... Guess I'll put it on , it's not on ,  .  But anyway , She has , .. um , ... she -- he's like taking her as a- -- ... you know , helping her out , and stuff , you know , for the summer , she's been working with him all summer ? ... And , ... it's really different , to see a girl doing it . you know . you just don't see that . ... at all . .. ever . Jorgensen's have a ... g -- .. or a g- -- .. you know a guy , they've had a guy being a horseshoer for , a long time you know ? And they , are um , ... there's this girl , that's working with him , for the summer ? Unhunh . And she's gonna be a ferrier . ... Yeah . ... I couldn't believe it . And she's just little . ... She's a tiny girl , but , boy I tell you , she's got arms the size of -- .. they're huge . but she must only -- ... What is m- ... blowing out of there . Well , that's what happens with that air conditioner . it's just -- ... it gets dust accumulated in it , see it's all over the TV . ... It was just on last night , how does it get dust in it already . Well , I -- It .. Mae Lynne , .. for one thing the .. filters are dirty because it .. it so -- .. been so dry . ... And the -- .. it all comes acrost , ... the road . .. you know ? .. and , .. and then it builds up real bad with , ... deposits , out of the water . Oh . In other words I .. should be .. change filters . Ugh . ... God . ... I know . ... It won't last long . ... But , .. it sure does make a mess in the house . Yeah . it makes a mess . I need new filters .  ... Anyway , this girl must only weigh like , a hundred and ten pounds . .. I mean , she's just a little shit . and she's out there , and she's got huge arms . I mean she's in shape like you can't believe . .. She's out there just , .. working away . ... And , those guys are so used to it , that they do it all day long . you know . Mhm , And that doesn't bother em a bit , to just go out there and , .. trim and trim and trim . .. And shoe , and everything , but , .. for me , .. that's something I'm not used to . and boy I tell you . you just -- sweat just rolls off of you . I just , it's tiring . ... The very -- ... at the very beginning , nan when we first started doing it , we only did like one hoof ? Then we moved up to two , .. Then we moved up to a full horse , you know ?  And , ... We were just slowly got in shape . doing that . you know ? .. But now if I went to do that ? Holy okes . ... I'd never be able to handle it . Why . ... It's just -- it's a -- it's hard work . .. It is really hard work . ... You're bent over , and it's -- ... you know , it takes like None -- ... I don't know why you sweat so bad doing it either , but you just , oh , it's just , ... it's just hard hard work . It -- it doesn't seem like it would be , but , ... it is . It's really takes a lot of muscles to do it too . I mean a lot . Those -- ... It's hard . You don't get kicked a lot ? .. I've never been kicked , ever . .. But like , it- those college h- is course , you know , like I was talking , our horses are a little better than , most people's horse , cause they've been around people a lot ? And they , ... they don't get by with stuff . I mean , we do get mad at our horses for , ...  you know , whatever they do wrong , we do get mad at em , like I noticed , horses at college , they just haven't been disciplined enough . and they're just , .. it's like a kid , they're just , ... are ornery , you know ? And like , they'll move around , and , ... kinda be ornery about half way , but not ... not too bad . ... I've never been .. kicked doing it at all . And that's another thing we had to learn in the class you know , just had to learn ... our safety of , where to stand , and how to stand , .. You have to stand like these certain ways , and , .. oh and it's a killer on your back , cause you're standing like this . Oh I'm sorry Berry . You're standing -- MIC Whoops .  ... You're standing like this you know ? And like , when you're in the back , the horse's hoof ... lays like this right over you ? and you're , .. like this working ? you know ? This is like a hoof knife , then a -- you know . So you're always bent over . You're always bent over . .. And like in the front ? You stick the horse's hoof .. between your leg , you know ? ... Kinda like that , and you kinda , you go like this , you kinda bend down like this , and you have the horse's hoof right here ? It's hard on your back .  It's really hard on your back . .. Like , .. I noticed that girl's back muscles were just tremendous . too you know . ... Couldn't believe it . ... She had like on this .. really .. p- kinda short shirt , you know ? There's this -- ... I think that's cold . ... Just don't -- .. it's -- if you rub something against it , it's just -- .. Makes a sound ? ... Nkay . ... So what -- .. what were you gonna do out there today . What other -- .. what other things were you gonna -- ... Just go out and um , ... Look at the filly ? ... Yeah . .. .. I think more or less , it's getting about , .. so late now . ... Pretty much all we're gonna do is go out , .. I don't know what her plans really are . .. But I think pretty much just go out and take care of em and then , maybe go to that ... seasonal dance , or whatever it is . ... Is that what it's called ? ... I don't know . ... I don't know what it's called either . ... You know , he said there was four guys doing that ? ... Doing what . .. The dance , you know ? .. How he said there's four guys , I wonder if that means like , .. Since there's four seasons , you know ? I wonder if that has something to do with it , Unhunh . since he called it a seasonal dance .   ... He's a pretty neat guy . ... I thought . ... Yeah , he spoke Crow okay . ...  ... I got a kick out of him when he kept saying it , See this little cat . .. ... Little cat- -- I don't wanna see the little cat . ... I know , I know , that sounds like kitten . that sounds like kit- -- I don't wanna say kitten , that sounds stupid . ..    ... So she named everybody in the class except for -- .. About .. four people . Well , .. I think they asked for names . .. Oh did they ? ... Hunh . ... That's funny . ... ... Look at how much that air conditioner blew on that blue bag right there . ... Yeah , I noticed on the -- ... on the case for the tape recorder too , that it's all -- that it's all covered today . ... Look right here . Look at your cigarettes even . Look . Right here ? .. Just -- Geez . just from sitting here . For just a minute . .. That's -- Look at the cigarettes . ... It's like ash . Is it from -- .. that must be from the fires ? Or what . ... You know , maybe it is . ... Maybe it is . ... Uh -- Cause that one whole day , you couldn't even see or anything , .. from , but look at your cigarettes . ... Just sitting there . Oh yeah . ... On the way into r- -- .. from .. Roundup , .. yesterday morning , the radio was on ? ... And they were , .. talking about the weather and they said , .. how we , everybody woke up with ash all over their car today , and , ... In Roundup ? .. On the way from Roundup . .. I was listening to the radio . ... Yesterday morning . ... And they were talking -- And so this was probably like a Billings radio station , or something like that ? Yeah , 2.. Unhunh .  .. Is that right . And they said well everybody woke up with ashes on their car today . ... And I guess just from the fires . Yeah , it is . I was telling Mae Lynne , Hunh . ... Uh , ... day before yesterday , it was the most weird day I've ever seen in my entire adult life . ... It was um , ... the wind was blowing real hot when I first got up . ... And it was early . .. Real early , like seven o'clock in the morning , that -- .. that wind was just hot .  And , next thing you knew , it was just overcast , .. well the oke all blew in . Just like there was a fire . right around close . And it was just .. dense . You couldn't even hardly see , very far away . Okay then , ... it -- .. that -- .. s- nan -- .. it just kinda blew the oke in , and then blew it out , but , then it was real hazy , and there was just dust particles , all over . and it was , you'd look at the sun , and it would just look red . I mean you couldn't see the sun . .. It was just -- .. She said people were driving around with their lights on . Yeah . And the lights were -- ... they didn't look like they were -- ... it's just from the drought and the dust , .. you know , .. and the oke in the air . ... I've never seen anything like it . .. And she said like , .. the lights looked .. a greenish color . Yeah . They look a green  . You know how they look yellow at night , you know ? ... Yeah . they just looked green . ... It was a weird . .. ugly . .. ugly day . .. Rana Lee's gonna have a baby by the way . Who is ? Rana Lee . ... Brian's .. wife ? Brian's wife . ... I didn't even know she was pregnant , three months ago . ... Of course I guess they can get big in three months , Well , .. I .. I told you . too . What's her name ? ... Bran- -- what's her name ? .. Rana Lee . ... Rana Lee ? .. Unhunh . ... Rana Lee . Hm .  ...  I don't know why I told you that . ... Rana Lee . ... She had a brother that died from asthma too . ... Seem like a lot of people . ... I mean that's weird , that I would know two people that died from asthma . You know ? Why don't we .. go , just in -- except -- Just in a matter of a .. year's time ? This washing is  . ... Really . ... Yeah . ... Her brother was like , ... just right out of high school ? .. I mean , you know , did mom tell you , .. about Deb at all ? .. She probably really couldn't , since Genetta was there . You know , she was- -- like she was in the hospital , in and out of the hospital all the time and stuff , ever since she was little , .. she was in and out of the hospital , .. Who was that . Debby ? .. Debby . ... I mean she was in- --  she loved horses so much ,  stuff on it .  and she was always , like , she's allergic to horsehair , horse sweat , ... Oh .  You know , stuff like that , but she wouldn't quit riding em . so , ... Well  , she's allergic to everything , it doesn't matter .  was saying , it didn't matter what she did , ... Did she ever go to a allergy doctor ,  . .. or anybody like that ?  Oh yeah . She .. t- -- .. ... well they -- she never did take shots . Did she . No , I don't know why . They should've , .. they should have gotten her -- ... I don't know why they didn't either . I -- (%) I w- always wondered about that , and she was s- -- .. she had such severe asthma , that , I would have done a little bit more for her I think .  If you wanna talk about somebody tired , that girl , ... that girl couldn't ... walk down to the street and back , without taking a nap . ... And me and mom always accused her of being lazy . ... You know , because she was just , ... all she did was sleep . ... She sounded like she had more problems than -- and now that when we think about it , ... she probably wasn't really ... lazy , she's probably just exhausted , I mean , you know , if you think about it , we like take .. everything for granted . We take our air for granted . You know ? ... Then somebody like that , ... every little breath is like .. and effort to em , d- -- and you know , and if I had to go through an effort , just in breathing , all the time , .. Well Debby got- -- I would be tired too . .. Debby got to the point , where all she would do is , when she did , ... you know every- -- .. just , .. really often she would go  , to try to get enough air in , .. and her , they had an autopsy done on her . And her heart , .. was just hard , on one side , from , labored breathing all of her life . It had just labored her heart so bad . She actually died of a heart attack . She did . Yeah . ... They did have an autopsy done on her . Yes . ... It surprised me . ... But they -- they did . ... And it was actually a -- And her heart was hard ? cardiac arrest . .. Mhm . One side of her heart was just hard . from , ... the muscle -- the muscle was just hard , from just .. labored breathing , Geez . trying to breathe all the time . ... That's just sick . ... Yeah , we thought she was just lazy , and kind of worthless , but , ... we didn't realize what she was going through . ... And you know , ... maybe that's another reason why she didn't really -- maybe mom she kinda knew about all this stuff . And maybe that's why she didn't really , ... pay that much attention to Amanda . I mean not because , I mean it seems like she'd pay more attention to her , but maybe it's because she wanted to have a little fun in her life too , and knew it wasn't gonna , last forever for her . You know ? ... I mean , I guess like right before she died and stuff , she's like telling her mom like , ... well if I go , I want this here , and I want that there , and , ... You know , just little things , Is Amanda her kid , or , .. Yeah . Oh . she had a little three-year-old daughter . ... It's just too bad . ... I just hope Orville and Genetta get that little girl . Oh they won't . there's no -- Are they even trying ? They can't -- .. They want her three months out of the year , but they have no legal grounds . I mean , ... You know , he is the legal father , and , ... there's not much they can do . Oh she was divorced ? .. Mhm .  .. Yeah , and he is such a weirdo . ... This is the type of person , ... that ... is like ... a hermit . .. I don't know what you'd call him . Well they were .. rai- .. raised ... backward . He's like -- ... Uh , .. back woods . .. Back woodsy . raised in the mountains . didn't d- -- ... Never came down out of the mountains . .. He doesn't have any -- ... He doesn't know what's going on in this world . .. No he doesn't . .. He was just not properly brought up . He -- I mean he wouldn't even have the slightest idea  . Where was he from . ... Um , ... I forget . Idaho ? Idaho , and , up in the mountains , In Idaho .  ... Um Macley , and , ... Arco ? ... Isn't that where Deb .. kinda was ? ... But he's just really really really strange . How can you teach a three-year-old to tap dance . I can't imagine teaching a -- Yeah , really . ...  ... Who suggested this to em . I have no idea . It was probably my .. sister-in-law idea because , ... I think they saw ... that movie . ... Tap ?   -- What was the , They had -- the movie with that .. really hot tap dancer . Oh that kid . ... He was actually here two weeks ago , and I missed him . at the .. at the jazz .. tap thing or whatever . Was he a little kid ? No he's sixteen now .  No he's like -- ... Yeah he's a teenager , but he teaches these classes in New York . That boy , .. he's supposed to be awesome . Yeah . ... Really fast . Hm . ... But I'm sure that was the .. the impetus . Have you seen him ? .. No . I just read an article on him . .. You .. you probably read the same Examiner article I read . Yeah , probably , yeah . talking about how Gregory Hines said , he doesn't realize a human being can't tap that fast ? Right . Right .  Yeah . And they were talking about how , ... he's teaching these classes , Hm . and I guess he really goes fast . And , Yeah . he k- -- ... He doesn't explain anything precisely . He has to double it down to like one fifth speed or something , before they can g pick it up , ...  Well I'm sure Thomas is all over it . ... Probably   -- I mean he has a bro- --  could have seen him . I guess that means his broken leg is doing okay . I was wondering about that , I was imagining he had broke an arm or something . None Oh yeah None . But it was his leg ? .. Yeah . That's like , .. I guess that he was being hauled around in a little wagon and stuff . Right . ... He healed very quickly . Guess kids' bones , just like .. grow back really fast . Mhm . Yeah . I think they're really soft to start with . They're made of rubber . ... Th- that's it . That's why b , .. little kids usually don't break their legs anyway . .. Cause they're so  . Cause they're made of rubber . But they have more cartilage than w , ... you know . Yeah , aren't they real s , .. aren't their k- .. legs pretty soft ? Yeah , there's less calcium deposits in them . ... And also , Mm . .. they're still growing . ... And the way ... bones grow is , .. you make cartilage , .. and then you deposit calcium in it . Oh , and then that turns into hard bone . So that's why they always have ... more flexibility . Cause as they're growing , Hm . ... you're making cartilage . So it al- -- Mhm . They always have that , until they reach adulthood , ... in which case , ... They get old and cranky like the rest of us . it stops .  Unhunh , ... (SNIFF) and then they break . ... Old and rickety and brittle . .. Mhm , Mhm , uncoordinated and .. unflexible . ... Right , ... Stiff . Inflexible ? ... That too . ... What are you planning on doing with dancing , Harold ? ... You were taking some classes last fall ? .. I'll take a few more . as a -- You will ? It turns out as a spouse , I get in free .  Oh really . So , That's not bad . to group classes , yeah . ... Hm . So , I should do that . Oh really ? Mhm . ... That's why you married her .     Some benefit , Mm , hunh .   Mhm ,  Better than nothing .   None Oh None , I cannot believe you said that .  What a jerk you are  .      Aren't you guys gonna stick up for me ? and beat up on him or something ? He's bigger than I am .  ,  He's not bigger than you . .. No . But he's my --  he's my friend . Tha- that's right .   You know who I'll stick up for .    ... I stuck up for you today at that store . That's TRUE . ... You did . You made me get the , Mhm , um , that's right . the green scarf . ... That's right . ... He was my fashion consultant today . Right . ...  Hm .  ... I wasn't ? ... That's right . Well you- -- .. I don't know . ... We were at this dumb store , and the clerk .. kept trying to keep us interested , Hm , while she was buying . that's right . ...  Don't you wanna try on the men's clothes ?  . I'm the one who suggested that , so you wouldn't be so bored .  Well I- -- So they tried on the men's clothes , and they had a very all selection of men's clothes ,  Mhm , they try on these really great pants , and they look really good .. in them . ... Then they didn't buy em . .. Right . ... Well . ... You know how boys are . ... They never buy clothes . Broke . ..  Broke , Yeah . ... Students are .. are broke .  Right . ... nan , is that that ? ... Or is that a real -- Yeah , that's a tape . That's a tape . Where's it coming from . ...  the speaker over there . The speakers . You know these .. boxes ?      ...  -- You must have good stereo . Cause I feel like I'm hearing -- We have -- These are like , the world's worst speakers . Where is the other one . These are the shittiest .. speakers on earth . Over here .  ... besides the ones in the kitchen . And these are an improvement over my last ones . I thought that was the real thing . ... You think we have like a jazz band next door ? In fact I was getting ready to say ,  ... is there somebody downstairs , .. playing ?  I mean that was what I first thought ,  It's our garage band . when 2.. when the jazz came on . ... As compared to the other stuff , for some reason it sounded like it was out there , or kind of .. coming in from some place , Unhunh ? Hm . Hunh . Well that would be nice to have a little jazz band next door , Right . wouldn't it . No . Mhm . ... Usually we just have really loud salsa parties across the street . That's fun too . ... And teenagers . .. kissing each other on the sidewalk . Hm . Hm . KISS ... And little kids throwing paint in your backyard . Yeah . ...  ... (SIGH) And in the front yard . You saw that  , I saw that , .. right in the front , But -- Well what is it , paint ? It was the same 5.. color or something . It was like , Or is it chalk . 5... Well I k- -- I went out one morning , and I saw it all around , and it was like on the back bumper of the Honda , too . Oh rude . So I .. thought oh shit , I'd better try to wipe that off , so I ... I got , I went and got a wet rag and wiped it off the car . And it came off really easily . And then I saw there was like this tube of it , But it was paint ? This whole tube of it across the street . Those kids are just -- sitting in the gutter . So I 2.. threw it away , And she's pregnant with another one . There gonna have another nan Which one is pregnant . nan brat 3.. kid , The the 4.. the really fat red-haired woman ? The mother . The  None get over here you , nya nya nya nya nya nya nya None . Does she even have a b- a man ? I guess she must . ... Does she have a what ? A man . A man .  ... She has some kind of a -- At least temporarily , Yeah , Yeah .  At one time . For about five minutes , probably .    And they were banging their .. their soccer ball up against our -- .. below the bedroom .. th- the study window ? So Jamie the old lady went and yelled at em . I opened None -- Mhm , Ah , you mind moving , getting away from there , thank you .  I felt like such an old lady .  It's so bad , With those kids , they make us feel so old . How many of them are there . 2.. Eight hundred . nyow .  There's two .  . (HISS) No , there's ,  There's two young ones , and one .. who's like twelve ? Oh , the cow . who has .. friends ? Unhunh . The- the cow . Hm , The older cow , and then there's .. the middle cow , and there's a little young cow ?   The little baby cow , 3.. The butterball ? The calf ? Gee Zheezhee . The butter-  , Zheezhee the calf ? The butterball  .   The butterball . They used to have this little butterball , r- -- when we first moved in , he would ,  ... he'd be running around , ... d- in the street with his diapers on . ... this butterball of a kid . and then he'd stop and go ,  . He'd wheeze , ... once he stopped running . Cause he's so fat , .. that whenever he runs , he gets really winded . ... And he's , .. you know , .. a year and a half yea- .. years old . Or two years old . A year and a half old . ... A year and a half years old .   ..   Uh . ... They're terrible . ... Really . I can't t- -- How do you -- She just looks pregnant ? now ? She's pregnant . She's totally pregnant . Oh . .. It's not .. eating too much , she's pregnant . So , I guess , ... I mean thi- this- thi- this just happened ? Or , We're gonna have babies crying . ... in the middle of the night . (GROAN) ... Well it's no worse than her screaming at em , is it ? ... Yeah but now you'll have both . ... Yeah right . ... Probably be like , shut up you ki- , you know ,  ? Oh God . ... I feel -- I s- feel like such an old lady . But I -- they just really annoy me . ... kay , Hunh . New subject ,  Hm .  Well it's cause they have no respect . Yeah , I guess so . ... Those two top masks , .. there . ... Yep . ...  We need a verb . I guess the ones below are women ,   Is that why they look so different ?   .. Uhoh . I mean , .. i -- ... Well you see their eyeballs , I guess . Right . .. Yeah the other -- In addition to a mustache and a beard . ... But the thing is , that second one looks like the guy who was in one of the Oba Oba skits . Do you know those -- .. any of those dances ? All of em . All of em ? None  ... The little what ? ... Looks like , .. the second nan Why , nan one from the top looks like a guy who was in the Oba Oba k- skit . ... What's an Oba Oba skit . Oba Oba , oh the Brazilian troop that was here , dancing ? Yeah . Oh yeah ? ... I never saw that . Look like -- .. nan a real- -- an actual person doing it , or some kind of masks they had , or , No . Uh , the guy looked like that . Or there's a guy looked like that .  Yeah ,   That's pretty good ,  Just like him . With the right -- I mean that looks kinda like a Black person . With red eyes , and everything ? So where is this from . ... This isn't from Africa , is it ? .. No . ... From Indonesia . ... But that person looks Black . ... Which one is it ? Or do Indonesian people look Black . Looks pink to me . The- -- which one . .. The -- .. I figure the second one from the top . Tumenggung . The second from the top , Tumenggung ? ... Hunh . I look at that and think , yeah , that looks like a brother . ... That's interesting ,   .. cause I think Indo- Indonesians , think  ? or , .. people who've been to Indonesia , .. think that those guys , like the two top ones , ... have really European characteristics . ... compared to Indonesians . Uh , ... Just cause their eyes are real big and their noses are big . Their eyes are round . ... Oh really ? And Indonesians have real thin eyes , and , ... and flat noses and stuff . ... I don't know . ... Except those , .. well , ... I don't know , the- -- .. the bottom ones don't have flat noses either . That's TRUE they all have b- -- they all have big noses . ... But they get bigger as you go up anyway . What do you think makes em look African . ... Their mustaches ? ... Is it the -- ... the way their little beard goes ? ...  Oh no . That's not even relevant . ... I- d- -- I just glanced at that , Hunh . and I immediately saw this guy's face in Oba Oba . Yeah . Hunh . That's interesting None . He looks like .. that guy . ... Poor guy , .. That is really interesting .    ..  Yeah . Bulging eyes . ... Cause I remember , he came to Bahia after one of his shows one night . .. 's kinda funny . Wow . ... Well the top guy has a real thick lip . Oh in his black leather jacket and his black nan Mm . Klana has a real thick lip . nan hood hat , Right . ...  Pretty bad overbite too , He's in Oba Oba , you know ,  oking , He didn't -- Yeah .  Then he tried to -- He danced with ... a friend of mine . ... Yeah , what happened . But she didn't wanna dance with him anymore , I said , .. boy , he just wanted to get close to me . .. Oo . Oo . Mm . I said , well , can't blame him . Oba .. Oba .  myeah . Gross . ... Mm . ... But I'm sure those guys get a lot of attention from women . They travel all over the world . .. I'm sure a lot of women throw themselves at em , so that's what they expect from women . ... A lot of groupies . .. Yeah . ... Fringe benefits . Hm . ..  .. The only fringe benefit of being a dancer , probably . .. Well in San Francisco , But then again , .. you never know if it's a benefit or not , either . That's TRUE .  ..  ... I didn't know this , but apparently in .. Brazil , they have a very very high AIDS infection rate . Really ? Oh . Oh . probably  . It's supposed to be .. very high . Mm . ... You mean like , Very unmonitored , higher than the United State- -- too . .. Higher than around here ? That's what I've heard . .. Hm . .. I wouldn't be surprised None . Have you heard these figures . that like , um , ... it's something like forty percent of males , in .. the Bay Area , are supposed to be infected ? Well , last July , Oh really ? .. this is what -- Of homosexual males , or of males . Of all males . Of males in general . This infectious disease woman , Or males under thirty I think it is . at San Francisco General , Mhm , she said that , ... this doesn't seem like it can be TRUE , but she said that , ... ninety per cent of gay men , ... are HIV positive , ... and fifty percent of all males , ... are HIV positive . Yeah . That's what she said . .. Fifty perc- -- It was some -- .. Like , .. a- m- -- half or more than half of , and it was .. fairly young men , ... but , were , had been exposed to HIV virus . It wasn't necessarily that they were ... infected . .. Well , if you're HIV positive , ... it's the same difference , ... Mhm . since they feel that , ... sooner or later you'll come down with the actual disease . Mhm . Yeah . ... But that's what she said . .. Now I don't know if she meant the Bay area or San Francisco ,  but those are some ferocious numbers , if one out of nan Yeah . That's just horrible . nan two guys , ... you meet , .. yeah ,  cause there're a lot of women out there who .. apparently don't believe in using condoms . ... Hm . ... I'm just amazed .  dumb move . See I'd heard that it was mainly , Really dumb . in 2.. t's mainly urban areas , Yeah . that had this really ... disproportionately high .. propor- -- ... um , ... percentage . And then like , .. r- rural areas , or , like , you know , central Iowa and stuff , .. had like ... ten percent or less , ... of the males , .. had been infected . Well I would assume San Francisco is higher than most cities around the country , Unhunh , Mhm . But , ... that just blew me away . .. Cause I'm thinking well gee , if half of all the men are HIV positive , what does that mean about the women they're having sex with . Right . .. Yeah . .. Well , But , .. and just talking with guys ,   . ... in their twenties , why , ... I mean these guys , ... say these women don't care if they use rubbers or not . This is what guys have been telling me , ..  ... you know , and I'm thinking , I- I can't believe that , cause in this city , .. with all the information available , It seems like , Right yeah -- Stupid . people , people have the information they need . It is just amazing , that people in their twenties apparently aren't . Right . ... That's really scary . .. So I guess it's time for me to become a priest . ..  It's too dangerous out there . Oh , I don't know . I couldn't believe it . This ... woman I knew I was gonna ask out ? .. God . You have to be Catholic first . Her sister , who's an HIV counselor ,    ... was telling me how her sister just won't use rubbers . ... None at all . Hm . .. Well where would she put them . and I'm thinking , ...  I'm thinking , Well , how can you not , my sisters don't , ... I mean , ... what are they thinking . .. I don't know . ... Don't look at me . ... I- I was just really amazed to hear that , people in their twenties , We're innocent . cause I figure , .. We don't have sex . growing up around here , you would .. know better .  .. And in high school , you know , they teach about it . .. Mhm . ... So , I don't know . Not only that , but they have really lewd billboards all over the Castro district . ... Something's wrong   , I know ,  I thought we got our electricity fixed . that's kind of scary .  I thought I turned this off , though , It's been doing -- didn't I ? .. Oh , that's right , But -- you did . That's really scary then . This is salsa , right ? Yeah . ... What what -- .. Who is this . ... I don't know , it's from the radio station years ago when I was ... in Santa Cruz . ... You know on Sundays , ... at ten o'clock . ... That's right now . Kay , .. what is that . Kay , ... oh I don't know what the radio station is . They play Salsa ? It begins with a kay though . No , they played this --  They have a Brazilian jazz hour . Is there a KKSF ? ... I don't know what it was . But it was like I went to Bahia , What's -- ... last Sunday , ... got there at eight , .. left a ten , ... dropped this person off at home , in Foster City , and came back , and I  was noticing , .. the songs they were playing on the radio , were the exact same songs they were singing at Bahia , the- b- live band there . ... Hm , .. should I turn on the radio statio- -- You don't know what station it was on ? I- I was -- ... KKSF , .. does that mean anything to you ? ... Nope . ... You have to translate it to a number . I was in a rental car , so it was just whatever station it was on . Mm . ... Hm . But uh , I was just remembering being surprised , cause , I didn't realize , .. I don't know anything about Brazilian music . You go to the- .. Brazilian club , and they're singing .. songs , ... apparently I guess that's the popular stuff . .. I guess . ... I'm so used to hearing those songs , cause I've heard em for the past three months , .. I didn't think anything of it , but then , this guy played songs for a whole hour , and it was like , eighty per cent of those songs I'd -- .. that band had sung that very night . ... Mhm . ... ... Pickup band's pretty good there . ... Viva -- Well they have a different band every night . Who was it , Viva Brazil ? .. Oh , I went on the ,  . ... Friday night , so maybe it was different band . Um when did you do that ? (SNIFF) ... Oh , a while ago . ... The dance floor's too all in that place though . .. It's really annoying . ... I like this song None . ... Are they ... teaching ... any more lambada , ... at uh -- ... school ? .. Yeah . ... Vivian was giving a lambada lesson , Cause uh , when I was there the other day . well , my lambada's definitely getting better . Really ? ... Really ? I wanna go out lambada dancing with you . ...  -- I mean I'm gonna start dancing with those Brazilian women . ... So I can learn how to beat my hips , I mean , cause their .. their hips are SLAPPING beating up against you , ... you know , like that fast SLAPPING .  -- Hundred cycles per second , or something ?          I mean , I am not kidding . 3.. It -- It is a different sensation entirely .   When you're dancing with them . I bet .    And the- -- (%) only way to learn how is to dance with them more . That's TRUE . But I feel like I can start dancing with them now . ... But uh , ... No th- -- I don't -- .. I don't -- ... They haven't done anything recently , I , I can't remember if they're going to . Cause , .. like , Sue Swing taught that class for two months , ... May and June , ... and uh , Is she a good .. lambada dancer ? I can't imagine her being a -- ... Yeah but , I didn't feel like she taught it any different -- ... significantly differently than when Vivian and Jeff taught it . ... I mean , .. cause they do it nan real basic , .. and real simple . nan different , .. than Brazilians do it . Yeah . ... I mean , .. I don't know what those Brazilian women are doing , .. What are they doing , but their hips are like , Are they going -- are they going like , really fast ? .. I mean are they going one two three , I mean , one two three , first you had this wide sway of their hips this way , ... and then , ... it's like , ... SLAPPING they're .. coming , .. I mean , they're beating me like this SLAPPING . ... I don't even know how you can do that . .. You're dancing with them , SLAPPING they're beating you just like this . ... SLAPPING Using their hands like that ? ...   No , using their .. pelvic bones . Wow . Mm . Right here ? ... Yeah . Sort of like Tahitian dancers or something . Yeah . You know , close . But I tell you ,  .. but anyway , you know , they weren't teaching it that way ,   . You know , the ballroom people don't do it that way .   .. But that's what I want to learn . Don -- Don't they teach , don't they teach you to go , one two three , one two three , .. one two three , like that ? ... Or do they go like really fast like that . Well Sue Swing , I mean when she was teaching was definitely more sedate , and the same thing with Jeff and Vivian . Viv , Yeah . It was just Jeff and -- 2.. sure , but that's cause it's for s- -- it's for people who can't move their hips . ... Right ? I mean it's for basic , .. you know , this is a beginning lambada class , or intermediate  , I don't know why they did it that way . I mean , .. it seems to me if they're gonna teach it like what you do , ... nan ... Or what they teach , and what happens socially , could be two different things . .. You know , ... I mean , Brazilians definitely don't , ... hm , do it like that  . ... I should -- I want to go . I should check it out . .. I like that , cause it's fun . ...   None -- I mean after I f- -- ... I mean I -- Are you -- Do they still teach at Bahia on Sunday ? .. night ? Oh yeah . ... In fact I would have gone today , if it wasn't for my back . ... Well I finally found some people there I can dance with . .. So that helps . Do you need a partner ? ... To go there ? .. Yeah . .. No . ... Besides , you , ...  I mean if you're a guy , .. If -- .. If you're a woman , I mean , those guys'll be all over you . ... I swear it .   Don't say that , Run along now , Harold's in the room . dear ,   .. You could come too .  Well I don't necessarily ... mean , .. .. in a bad way , even though I'm sure there are a few there , I'm not dancing with guys . .. All I can say is , the women aren't all over me . ... Darn , Oo . But ,     but I remember , like I went there with this person , ...  .. it's kind of funny . th- this person did not want to dance . ... So she's just gonna watch . So , every once in a while I'd get up and dance , ... and it's like , ... when I'd come back , I mean there was some guy there , sitting in my chair . ...  Every time I got up . I'm thinking , God , these guys don't waste any time . I mean , you turn your back , and there's somebody moving in . ...  I mean I don't know if they   .  Maybe Harold you should come with me . ... Why . ... So I can find -- .. learn some lam- .. lambada .  .. find some girls with empty chairs next to em ?    ... Maybe I should go with Miles . .. Oh did- --  Yeah , you guys could be partners . did- -- ... What ? Well I don't know if I told you , nan .. told you that story about that woman , ... who uh , went after that guy there ? I told you that story , right ? ... I was there Sunday three .. four weeks ago ? ... Uh , after the class is over w- -- .. over with , ... I'm sitting down at a table , there's a woman from -- .. who was in the class , and two men , ... sitting to my right , .. is a table with two women there . .. They had apparently just come from Oba Oba . ... on the last night , Oh I think you told me . the last night , Yeah . ... And like , well they were attractive women , the one had on a real real short skirt . Anyway , there was this guy in his fifties , .. out there dancing , ... by himself . ... And the woman was just looking at him , making eyes , then she went out there , got on her knees . ... in front of him . ... in this skirt that's this short , ... takes her hands , .. and goes along his toes , and then up , and is just .. doing like that . .. I figured , Oo . oh , they must know each other . ... Oo . .. very well , in fact . Mhm . ... Gross . That's what I assumed . ... And , .. they did that for the whole dance , and I mean , she was d- all kind of suggestive stuff , and touching him and everything , .. people would like ... cheering , CLAP and clapping , .. go for it . And all this kind of ... thing ? .. The- .. the song ended , .. the guy set down , .. at another table . .. And she .. set down , ... at a- -- at the table with her woman friend . They never danced again the rest of the evening . Hm . ... This is like , ...      so I was thinking , this woman's sitting ... about as far away from me as Jamie is . And I was thinking , hm , this is interesting . I wonder how long it was gonna take the guys in this club to move in on her . ... No sooner did I think this thought , guys were over there , .. What , .. you didn't ask her to dance ? ... Not Miles , he's just in daze . Well I was still trying to figure out , ...  surely they must know each other , I mean , .. why wasn't he sitting at her table ,  You mean , you werestill thinking about it .  Anyway , .. this guy , ..% ..% .. I mean he comes over there , .. immediately afterwards , the same guy who got his -- ... the same guy who's -- No , it's just some random guy . Or just some random guy . No , a random guy . .. who was like sitting about where you are . .. Yeah , .. He was sitting there , there were two guys sitting at a table right where you are . .. And then these two women are sitting here . So uh , he comes over there , and is talking with that woman . .. I don't know about what , but then like ten minutes later , ... she and her friend are over at their table . ... And then , ... twenty minutes later , they were kinda like .. all over each other . You know . ... kissing , et cetera , et cetera . And I was thinking , it looks like , .. these people aren't going home alone tonight .  ... Gosh , But I just thought that -- no wonder they forbid this dance . . So ,  Oh my God , what a story . ... Well , .. maybe I shouldn't go there then . ... Yeah , maybe you shouldn't  . It- it- it was interesting . No , .. I went there before , it was fine . .. it was really fun . You were there before ? Yeah . .. I went out there before . .. Oh . Without even telling Harold ? .. Without telling me ? nan You knew . .. If I was going out dancing ? Oh . .. Oh . .. I did ? Remember a few months ago I used to go out dancing ? .. every now and then ? Hmm , I don't remember . ... Well the thing that gets me , ... I meet this -- to Caesar's , and stuff ? ... .. I meet this psychotherapist . ... who tells me she's addicted to this dance . which I th -- think is a ... interesting choice of words for a psychotherapist to use . ... But uh , ... she's married , and apparently she's there .. without her husband . ... She has her wedding ring on . ... And it's like she's with this guy , and they're kinda like all over each other . .. And I'm thinking , well , ... I guess that's her husband , .. Uh-oh did you say something ? but I- --  but I was thinking , but the thing is , ... you know she's kind of all sophisticated and everything , and I'm thinking , you know , this guy nan , nan I can't .. really believe that guy's her husband . So I don't know what's going on here . ... And of course later on I find out , .. that's not her husband . ... ... So , I'm thinking , you know None , I don't know what's going on here .   But uh , ... nan .. bizarre . Gossip . ... But then she tells me , .. gee I don't know what it is about this guy I mean , I've been trying to tell him I don't want a sexual relationship with him , and I'm thinking , ... from the way they look , when I'd seen them three weeks before , it looked to me like they had one .  I'm thinking , you don't do that with- -- So -- This is all at Bahia ? strangers . All this stuff happens at Bahia . Yeah . Hunh ? ... To other people I mean . .  ... Well ,  , I mean maybe -- .. That was actually very profound . Yeah ,  that was .  Maybe you can just go up to a woman , and , you know , do that kinda thing . Yeah . You  -- You wind up getting punched , Mhm , is what'll happen .  Probably , .. something'll land in your mouth . Well , it sounds like there you wouldn't be though . What ? Yeah , right .  ..  I really , was wondering what that guy was thinking . He must have been -- j- since he didn't know her , .. that must have been quite a shock . That was really weird . .. That sounds really weird . I mean , you're -- y- y- fifty year old guy , and , .. some .. twenty-year-old woman comes up doing that to you , uh , what do you think . ... I think you think , you better go back to your table , fast . Right . .. Apparently . ...  .. I'll f- I'll tell you when I'm fifty what you think , okay ?  ... ... Mhm . ... What ? That'll be weird when you're fifty . ...  ... Wonder what you'll look like . .. Nobody's fifty , don't worry about it . Oh , okay . Ha ha ha , la lala lala . ... Oh well , .. ten o'clock . ... Look like it's bedtime for some folks here . .. Yep . Yeah , actually it's pretty much bed time for me soon . Hm . ... Yep . ... Well that was good ice cream . What kind of ice cream was that . .. Bud's . ... Pralines and .. cream- -- What is it called ? But what flavor ? .. Uh , pecan praline , Praline- -- p- -- or something like that . Right . Okay . Do you have a particular , um , .. use for the red peppers ,   as opposed to the yellow or green peppers . No no , it was all .. salad peppers . It's all salad peppers . Mhm . ... In that case I will use a yellow pepper for this evening . .. Oh , ... fabulous . ... Peter ,  would you like to ... string the beans ? What can I do . Sure . WHISTLE ...

None Creole seafood seasoning .  ..  ... See how hard we work , .. That's right . to feed our guests . I'm really impressed . Where is that salad spinner . Here it is . ... A dollar ninetyeight . And possibly the most spurious .. device ever invented . Oh I think it they're great . .. Do you have a salad spinner ? .. No . They're cool . ... Is this like something you had when you were young , in your own family ? .. No . .. It's brand new . Oh shit . Yeah , I don't think they ever -- .. did they actually exist back then ? Hey bud .  . No , and they probably didn't have to wash their salads back then , because they didn't know what was on them . ..  ... Yeah . ... They weren't crawling with disgusting pesticides . ... Conceptual pesticides . ... Whatever . ... Pesticides of the mind . ... What should I fry this fish in None . ... Could I ... beg your indulgence , ... my dear ? ... That I might slip in past you here ? ... You can . ... Sure . ... Okay , so did we decide we do or do not want potatoes . ... I think potatoes are excessive . I think we have enough food here . ..

Right here , Garlic , ... bread , ... and butter . ... right . ... Well actually I have Trader Joe's , ... whipped ... garlic bread .. spread . .. Oh boy . Oo .  So , we can dispense with the garlic and the butter . Right . Right . .. It's all -- That goes right along with the- -- .. the Cajun .. spice mix , I know , and , I know . It's just like , ... well , .. we could've gone out , hm . but , I wanted it to be home made None .  You know ?  ..  ..  Right , .. flavors of the evening . Now it will be the .. spray on  nan Just add food None .   Spray on ,   spray on olive oil . nan Oh boy .   None Woo None .  ... Is it really . .. Uh , .. yes . ... It's uh -- .. it's really icky . How bizarre . .. But , ... I'm gonna cut this up , so I can fry it None . ... S- -- .. How come like , .. the bread crumbs weren't already attached to the fish , or the pan ,  or something .   Well I probably could've bought it that way .  But I- -- .. you know , .. I said , I want it to be homemade . You know , something special . .. Well at least they are uh like already breaded -- Hm , .. I mean crumbed and in the jar , they're working on breeding .. pre-breaded .. red per .  Yeah .  On fish farms . ...  ... Have you heard about these horrific ... uh new .. genetic ... developments , in .. in .. um ... food livestock ? .. Yno . .. Like what . Like they're , .. they're trying to breed , .. ho ho , .. they're trying to breed like a forty foot long tube chicken ? .. No  . You mean so that they can go right from that to Chicken McNuggets ? They're like , they're like 2 -- .. Yeah , and it ..

I read about this , This -- this is tube chickens . That's horrible . .. 5 That is the worst 5 . That's really TRUE ? I -- And it's just .. awful . Who wants to eat it . I think I'll dip these in egg . ... Course , Yeah . .. You know , .. the early man probably said ... the same thing about the first domestic chicken . ...  .. you know . .. .. Can you imagine , they're taking this beautiful jungle fowl , and they're leaving it in a box . That's gross . .. Right . .. Oh , I wonder if it's this horrible -- ... Is there something fishy that ells ? ... No . ... No , I- I think it's just residual , um , Residual fish ell , from the elly fish . fish ell from the ... potent red per . .. Well , .. it'll be unpotent in a minute . ... Not to worry . ... Let me see . ... What was I in here for , ... there's nothing worse than staring like a dope at your own refrigerator . ... Um , ... oh an egg . ... God damn it , what'd you do . ... You son of a bitch .       I threw a green pepper down your blouse . You threw a green pepper down my shirt . ... ..

In a fit of ... household efficiency . these guys ? Those . Yes . ...  , .. okay , egg . ... One egg will do ? ... So my mom didn't catch any fish . ... Mhm . .. Up north she said . ... Rotten luck . Where were they fishing . .. Like in lakes , or , .. Um , rivers , I think , or what . um , at the mouth of rivers , .. on the coast of Oregon . Oh . .. Oh my . ... Oops . .. Too late . ... They have some -- ... So like what are they catching , salmon and stuff ?  Or what . Yeah . .. Unhhunh .  And some guy who- -- .. who knows a good thing when he's on to it , .. calls them up . ... I see .   And says , .. oh . .. The fish are running , don't you want to come up here , and blah blah blah b- None -- And pay me zillions of dollars to , You know . Right . Pay me , Unhunh . pay me , you know , eighty dollars a day to run my boat . Right . ... Catch fabulous salmon . ... And they have it canned . Unhunh . .. You know , they eat it , ... when they're up there , .. and I guess they have some frozen , Right . but they have it canned and , Unhunh . .. put it in our stockings , for Christmas None . Aw . .. Isn't that great . ... It's ... nice for them . They have some recreation with it . ... But no salmon in your stockings this year . Hunh ? Spend their va- -- Well , they  have already done it . .. So . Oh . ... I mean , .. this was , ... another trip . This is the next trip . In fact , they were supposed to go up in um , ... more , .. you know , .. environmental thing . They were supposed to go up ... at the end of ... August . ... When .. they usually run , and , ... fish weren't running this year , you know , it's like everywhere . .. Nothing's doing what it's supposed to , .. anymore , .. anywhere . Mhm ? ... That's why that whole ... mountain climbing .. expedition was screwy . What .. mountain climbing expedition was that .  -- The one that we were .. part of , The 2.. expedition we went on in Nepal ? Oh that . 4.. in Nepal . Unhunh . ... Um , What was the problem . was supposed to be , ... Supposed to be perfect weather , right in between the -- Yeah , perfect weather , and all that stuff ? Unhunh . .. And they ended up getting .. early .. winter .. storms . Or late monsoon storms . Or whatever . ... Yeah , whatever , And that's , it was atypical weather . .. Mhm . you know . ... Everywhere .. we've been , ... in the past several years , .. everybody's talking about how , .. the weather just .. isn't .. normal . That's TRUE . ... That's definitely been the case in Indonesia , for quite a few years . Mhm . .. Really ? Really . .. Yeah . ... Well like , when I was .. living there for the couple of years , .. it was -- ... the rainy season was all off , .. you know , it rained during the dry season , and was .. dry during the rainy season , Oh really ? and stuff like that , yeah . ... Gee . And really really dry . They were having a drought while I was there . ... Yeah , I don't know , .. I mean -- .. I- I don't know if our drought here will ever break . I wonder if this is just isn't , .. This is it . .. Hm . the new weather for southern California . ... Well they -- .. they claim that there's these cycles , and that we're in the .. the middle of a normal cycle . .. I don't know how TRUE that is . ... Well , .. Thanks . I r- I really -- ... We read this great book . .. Called , ... The End of Nature ? .. Ew .  Sounds wonderful . By this guy , .. this , .. um , .. you know , Bill McKibben . twentyeightyearold , ... Harvard guy , Right , who lives out in the woods , .. a la Thoreau , mhm . .. anyway , art . ... And uh , ... it's called , .. yeah . It's called The End of Nature , ... and it's just really a scary book . You know . There's no natural world left . .. Right . All the natural world was gone in nineteen seventyfive , ... His premise is basically this . and now  , ... That , .. um , ... as soon as the world hit a point , ... where ... there was no more ... objectively pristine .. land . .. Unhunh . .. When , you know , ... they found pollution on top of Mount Everest , Right . mhm . ... and at the very bottom of the ocean . .. Right . .. Well , that's it . .. Mhm . Man has had .. some effect . ... On the entire absolute absoluteness of the globe . .. Right . .. So in principle , ... the concept of nature , as a system inside of which man lives , .. is over . Mhm , .. Right . .. And then , .. in practice , .. since then , which was fifteen years ago , .. mhm , ... man has had such dramatic impact , .. on ... what we used to think of as nature , .. that , ... ... that the only way to coexist with nature- -- It's no longer , ... nature , .. the quasi religious , .. overarching , ordering principle , Right . inside of which .. mankind lives , Wordsworthian nature . Mhm . and uh , you know , ... w- .. a a thing that we can all rely on as a balancing force , .. over and above ourselves , .. to order the universe . Forget all that . Mhm . Woo that's spicy . It's now , Shit .  2.. you know , the world is gonna be kept in order by the same people that brought you , (COUGH) (COUGH) you know , (COUGH) the atomic bomb , Right .  and , (COUGH) (COUGH) all that stuff . Right ? Right . .. Which just doesn't sound like a very practical ... proposal . Yeah . ... Wow . ... You know , the same people brought you the extinction of all the large mammals in .. Europe and America ,  . .. And the dodo . are now entrusted with , ... maintaining what's there ,  The rest of the natural world . maintaining the entire globe , .. for the rest of time . mhm . Right . ... Not likely . .. Mhm . ... So , .. that was his .. basic premise . And then he goes on , for the rest of book , to absolutely , Then it gets really depressing  . heartlessly , Oh good .     oh gee  nan heartlessly debunk , You haven't heard nothing , yet . all of the , you know , wateryeyed , .. new age , ... uh , various theories , ... of -- Gaia , and all that stuff . .. of how it might .. not .. be that way . Right . ... You know , .. so , Unhunh . ... forget it , .. forget it , .. forget it . Right . ... We're fucked . ... Mhm . .. Well I read it in the New Yorker , and I thought , oh no , one of those New Yorker articles , you know , .. yuck None . Right . And I -- .. It was really -- .. I read the whole thing , which is pretty rare  . ... Well my my . .. So I mean , .. but his premise is not that mankind can't .. survive on Earth . .. Right . ... His question is , It's just it's a whole different earth . can mankind spiritually survive , Right . .. in .. a ... metaphysical world , in which it is patently obvious , that man is the highest ... active ... principle . .. Mhm . .. You know . ... Outside of , ... completely faith-based belief in God , ... you know , which is , ... irrespective of any .. relationship to nature , .. Mhm . .. there is now , absolutely nothing , .. in the world , ... to which we are beholden . ... And he w- -- his question was , what impact is this gonna have , on the nan .. Sort of fucks up the animists . nan cultural growth ,  Right . of -- of the human species . Mhm . ... Do we even want this . Right . Do we want to be the guy in charge of the world . ... Unhunh . On the other hand , isn't he saying its too late ? ... Well he is kind of saying its too late . So , This is why its such a depressing book . right . .. He's saying , we already did it , .. and we haven't even thought about , So much for culture . whether we wanted to do it or not .  .. Right . .. This is typical . .. Yeah . .. You know , ... And -- and then it gets down to s- -- you know , I mean that brings into play , other people's remarks like , ... you know , the -- ... w- it's all fine and good for us in this generation , Let's cook those  . So like , to talk about saving the whale , rinse them or something ? Wash them ? Yeah . Did- -- Wash them . .. did you want them broken aller , or , Oh I think they're good like that . okay . Are they good ? That's good . ... Alright . ... Yeah . ... None Yeah None . You know , saving the whale , or saving uh ... the .. polar bear , Right . .. Pandas , or making sure there's enough grizzly bears , that's fine . ... mhm . But -- but , .. implicit is , that at any point in time , .. anytime in the future , ... that man the collective , ... you know , ... group , .. Mhm . or even , .. individual special interests decide , yeah , fuck the whales . .. Right . .. They're out of there . ... Bango . Mhm . ... And , ... so anyway , ... interesting book . ... I read it because of this project . You know . ... Which project . .. The animal kingdom project . Oh okay . ... I don't think I know about that project . It's a thing I'm doing for Disney . .. So is that .. why you went to Africa ? ... Yeah . ... Such a scumbag . So , .. He's going back to um , so he- -- ... Nepal . ... And , ... India too , .. when . .. November . ... Make me   . Those are not all related languages . ... No . .. They aren't . What . .. They -- they just all happen to be in Southeast Asia . .. Oh . ... That's why . Ilocano's in the Philippines . Right ? Right . ... I have a neat book , .. I don't know if you've seen . .. What's Cebuano . .. It's in the Philippines too . .. It's on the island of Cebu . ... Oh . ... Of course . .. Figure that one out . ... No , I can't . ... It's a department store in Tokyo . Um , ...  . ... a book called ,  . ... Power and Gold ? ... Power and Gold ? .. Power and Gold . .. It's all about ,  . ... Moslems . jewelry traditions , Hm . .. unhunh . of the .. archipelago , of Indonesia and the Philippines . Right . .. Oh that sounds great . Do you wanna see it ? Yeah . It was at the LA County . None  , I'll be back None . ... Oh it was like this -- The -- .. An -- exhibition . an exhibition thing ? Oh it's right here . Oh that sounds great . Mhm , .. it was neat . .. Did you -- ... you -- Did you- -- .. Oh no , you never went to Jakarta . ... No . Okay . .. Cause there's -- In the National -- Jakarta . No . .. in the National Museum they have a Gold Room . .. That has all this gold stuff . Oh God . It's really neat . You mean , ... not made out of gold , just -- No . .. Oh . .. I mean , it's this  -- it's called the Gold Room . Well aren't you neat . Look at those little ends , all wrapped up in that plastic bag . Well ,  ? .. Or do you like -- .. Should they go somewhere , where they .. they .. recycle , or , .. turn into compost , Um , or , .. we don't have a compost pile yet . so it just goes in the trash like this . That's part of my nan .. Which is where . nan landscape thing . .. Garbage is underneath . .. If you can save the bag , .. you can .. turn it inside out and save it . Oh , okay . It's okay , .. but , ... you don't have to . This is , ... this is -- There's already plastic bags in there , so , Yeah . ... I'll put these on the dining room table ? There's already a , 2..  . just -- ... Oh . .. Anyway . .. Mm . .. Hey that carrot's good . ... It's got -- .. it's really pretty -- Well that's good . it goes island to -- island system by island system . Are we ready to eat ? Should I start .. food ? .. Oh yeah . Let's definitely um , Make food .  of these ? .. Um , .. they go in , ... how about that . ... That looks good . ... Alright . I have that , and I have another one that's a museum catalog , called , .. Art of the Archipelago . ... I think that's what it's called . Which has Indonesian and Philippine .. architecture in it . Unhunh . .. I don't know if you've seen either of those . No . ... No . They're kind of neat . Yeah . ... These p- -- He- -- he , in here , has some theories drawing , ... at least art historical parallels , What am I doing . between motifs of the , .. Should steam these . ... people of Asam .  . .. Unhunh . .. Uh , .. with , .. with , ... mostly Batak and Dayak and nan Oh really . nan .. stuff . Yeah . Oh that's interesting . And actually when you see it , Unhunh . when you see them , Right . you can .. imagine , ... pretty clearly . .. Unhunh , Some connection . ... Anyway , .. interesting . Hunh ? yeah . ... That looks like enough salad . ... Oh I get it . ... Mar went out to put the -- ... You put the water on the .. plants ? .. Is that what was going on ? ... What ? .. You were watering with that ? Is that what you were doing ? .. Yeah . .. Yeah , .. that's good . Perfect water , Unhunh . ... actually , you know , I'd love to do gray water , ... Mhm . here , .. but , ... It's illegal . it's illegal . .. Really . .. How rude . ... Isn't that retarded ? Isn't that weird ? ... It is . ... They just built a .. a great big gray water processing center , .. at the laundromat , nan .. in the .. complex where I live . .. Oh . It's like right outside our back door . .. There's all these huge machines and stuff , Great m- -- that like .. filter it and all , and then it -- ... They're going to like , .. pump it into their .. watering system , for the ... apartment complex . Gray water systems are local to , ... I mean you get your own . .. You don- -- It's not like a .. big system somewhere . Right . Yeah . You get your own gray water system . Right . .. Yeah . Yeah , But this is like -- but .. it's a .. complex . .. Right . .. Cause , .. this is this apartment complex , and there's the .. laundromat , nan .. and they just ... dump the water , ... from that and everything . .. Well laundry's the best way , and showers . .. I guess . ... The best way , .. To get gray water . Right . Well I would think you wouldn't want to , .. think what might go down in the sink and stuff . ... You wouldn't want to what ? ... Well , ... I guess , .. I guess it's more , that- -- .. It's not that you don't want it on your lawn , it's that you don't want it sitting around . .. Before it goes on your lawn . Right . .. Right . ... Stuff from ... the sink . .. Yeah . ... Cause the stuff from the sink , would be great ... for your lawn , if it could get right out there . Right . .. Yeah , but then it would be sitting there , sort of .. decomposing , or doing its thing all over the lawn , instead of in a nice little .. compost pile . Yeah . So that's , Well ? ... Mm , Well not if you were careful . ... I mean , ... you know , if you -- if you -- ... if you didn't have , ... if you were really careful about your dishes , Right . and scraped em off , Yeah . and it was just ..  runoff . Mhm . Yeah . .. Well that would be good . ... Cause all of that stuff should go into the compost pile to begin with . But -- .. Yeah . .. Actually , you know , .. Zeke the sheik .. is a local . ... You know , the guy whose compost pile blew up ? ... Oh no I don't know about this . Didn't you hear about him ? No . It -- it caught fi- -- Here finish these up . ... It caught fire , ... and , .. um , ... he- -- he used the ... compost .. from the , .. um , ... place next door , .. that was a ... big big big cemetery . ... And , ... here , you wanna butter these ? The grass clippings . Mhm . A huge cemetery , Yeah . they would mow their lawns , Yeah . .. he would take the grass clippings . And he asked em , if he could have the grass clippings , for like fifteen years . Mhm , ... So he had this -- how many , just make three of em ? .. Mhm . None Is that what's happening ? .. Or however long the butter lasts ,   . ... Um , ... So he had , and , and it blew up . a forty foot tall compost pile . Unhunh . And it started to combust . .. you know , .. internally . .. Right . .. just sort of .. naturally ? Just like Dickens . .. Mhm . Spontaneously ? ... Yeah . ... Ah . ... Now what am I doing with this . ... So just like this ? ... Butter them ? ... It's already open ? Yeah . ... Okay . ... Yeah and split em . Okay . ... You didn't even split em . ... Presplit . ... Yeah , those are left over . They're probably -- .. Yeah , there might be mold . I think they're okay .  Oh , fine .    Mm .  Mm . None Delicious None . .. Mm . Nutty sesame ? Or -- .. What is this . .. Sourdough . Poppy seed ? ... Are they ? .. No . ... Is the mold . ... Oh yeah ? Oh . ... Oh .  .. No , How are the beans . sourdough . ... How are the beans . ..  Great . .. Yummy . Is this like , ... Delicious . uh , ... Checking for an expiration date ? .. no , I was just wondering what all the --   what all the black things were in it . ... Mold . Oh . ..  Right . .. Shall I do something civilized ,  like clear the table , (COUGH) (COUGH) or are we just gonna barbarian it out . ... No , why don't you clear the table . Unless we want to eat outside . ... It's dark , how will we see what we're eating . ... Candles . ...  ... You wanna eat inside or outside Pete ? ... I don't care . .. Outside's fine . .. Let's eat outside . .. Ju- -- But you still have to clean off that table , cause it's grody . .. Which table . .. This table here ? ... No , the table outside . I have to clean- -- .. the table outside . .. Mhm . ... It's .. dirty . A little outside cleaning . So , ... wash it with that cloth or something ? Wash it , .. wipe it down . ... Oops , sorry . ... Did I get you ? .. Nope . WHISTLE ... Thought I was gonna get you .  this away .  ,  . Shit . ... Beans , .. beans , .. beans . WHISTLE ... Oops . .. Shit . ... Oh I love green beans . ... And they .. are so good leftover . ... With lemon and garlic . ... So these are just the spices that are .. black and green and stuff ? .. I guess . ... Where's the black . .. I don't see any black . ... Well , I don't know . ... Well it's -- .. maybe just the light , It's kinda , .. I think it's oregano . I guess it's just really dark , .. it's oregano and stuff yeah . Dark oregano . ...  That famous black oregano .    . Alright . It's like , ... purple basil . .. Purple basil . ...  Right .   .. So should I just .. finish it all off ? ... Make this really .. decadent and rich and , Yeah . ... Mhm . ... Yeah . ... Get rid of it . ... Oh look , a little lemon from the tree . ... Ew , they're still kinda yucky . .. You know , we came back from a , ... we had to go to ... the Ritz Carlton , out in Laguna , .. for a .. event . .. .. And w- we were gone what . .. Four days . ... You know . S- really relaxing weekend , you know , it was really great . .. And I'd had this , ... I'd had a particularly stupendous time . Because I had to .. be a wife most of the time , but part of the time I got to be a worker , and do the really fun work , .. so it was really great . Unhunh ? I had a great time . And uh , .. we're pulling up , .. and I see this girl . Who I'd never seen before , sort of dart out of our driveway . ... Unhunh , And ... stand there , and watch us pull in , and she goes like this . .. ... Like , .. oh my God . I'm gonna getting caught . And I said , ... hi , can I help you ?  You know . ... And she goes , .. and I- -- You know , of course it's this long drive , so I -- I probably look like ... total hell , .. Right . and she goes , .. Oh , um , I was just getting ... some lemons .  And I said , oh yeah ? .. Who are you . ..  And she goes , .. oh , .. I'm your next door neighbor . ..  No she said -- First she said , Kenneth said I could have some . Who's this guy , .. this old guy across the street . .. Unhunh . So Roy had said ... to him , .. if you ever want lemons , you know , go ahead and .. and have em . Right . Then he said , ... she said , oh Kenneth said I could have some lemons . .. Right . I said , .. he did .  She goes , Yeah . ... And I said , oh -- And she goes , do y- -- you don't mind , do you ? And I said , well yeah , in fact I do mind . Cause I thought the lemon tree was dying . I didn't see any lemons on it . .. Unhunh . Cause she said , you wouldn't mind if I came back and got a whole bag full , would you ? Right . I said .. yeah .    There's like one lemon left on this tree that I can reach . Right . You know ? Unhunh . ... Roy's about to go to Africa , and so I'd never- -- you know , I'd have to get a ... step ladder out , to pick my own lemons and stuff . ... Give me a break . I have to use a um , .. what , this abrasive sponge , to clean that table off . ... Okay . ... Why , is it grody ? ... Well it just doesn't come off very easily . ... Should I make like tartar sauce , or something really decadent ? .. What's this in this squirt bottle ? ... Um , .. Windex . ... I'm gonna use some of that . Does tartar sauce go with .. with Cajun spices . ... Well we could make -- ... I mean , that doesn't matter , I suppose it just -- Oh , you know what , we have this neat .. island ... mango sauce . Fields -- Mm . (SNEEZE) .. Chutney sauce . Chutney . That would be good . .. Yeah . ... I have tons of chutney . ... Well that sounds good . Chutney . ... Do you save these things ? ... Um , I think that one'll save . Yeah . Oh okay . I'll just ... put it ... in the sink . None Sure None . ... What are those little things called . all plastic nan ... Containers ? nan re-useable containers ? Right .  ... I guess . .. Mm . ... Oh , this looks yummy . ... Oo . .. That's really good . .. A little salty . ... Mm . Mm yeah . .. Oh , .. I guess we ought to put those in the oven , if we're gonna eat em . Hm ? ... It says chicken livers on it ? ... Yeah . ... It's amazing what happens if you keep it in the fridge long enough . That's right .    ..  ..  ..   .  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  I figure , .. every -- What goes around comes around . You know ?    Everything'll mutate into something you can eat eventually .    2..    But seriously folks . ... That looks good . ... Oh , ... shit . ... Are we flaky yet ? .. No , oo . Not even close . ... Yum . ...  do anything ? My but it's hot . ... I know . .. In here you mean ? .. Yes . Well we got everything on . The oven , You could say , None my butt .. it's hot . ... My butt . (COUGH)  Where did that come from . Why did we start saying that . ..

The first week , I .. played with them all week long , which was really stupid , because they got worked up ,  And the second week they were just like , , and so I had to scream at them ,    all week long .  And it was really awful , cause I felt horrible about it , cause I had to do shit like , they have a conduct chart . conducta . Right ? And all week long I threatened them with it . You know , ..

These kids are so -- .. I mean , their parents are so disinterested , ... in them ? .. th- -- ... Yeah , and their education , because these are -- Oh I believe it . .. These are parents that have come from places like El Salvador , BARK and Columbia , Well , and they have never learned English . BARK BARK BARK  And they have never been educated . Mhm . They look at you and they --  And they're like , ... I'm just waiting for my kid to grow up so that he can work construction with me .  You know , I mean a couple more years ,  .  . he'll be ready . ..  ..  They're in fourth  grade ? They do shit like i- -- Yeah . I mean they do stuff like , Oh , yeah . .. They , they'll come , and they'll take 2..  their kids off , BARK BARK BARK ... you know , half way through school to Mexico , and never come back . And they would -- Like , .. I have couple parents , .. who still , I keep s- sending messages home with their folks , saying , please , you know , in Spanish ,  ... call the oficina , you need to fill out this form , because your kid ,  .. can't have free lunch . ... Like for my first week there , I had , like , five dollars to my name , or something like that . ... I .. gave it all to the kids . ... all week long , Mm . because their parents , big mistake .  were too lazy to come ,   . ... and , .. and fill out the stupid form , .. you know , an application . .. That takes two weeks to ... process ?  Yeah , that takes two weeks to process . I mean , how do you explain that to th- -- Yeah but , is the form in English ? ... They have a form in Spanish also . Well , even if it's in Spanish , maybe they can't read . .. Well -- Yeah . Mhm . That's very probable , you know , but , ... um , ... I've -- No , .. cause I've received notes back . Grapenuts . Especially from this one girl . ... You know , Dear and esteemed teacher .   Hunh . You know , in m- -- in Spanish . ... My child , you know , has already .. filled out this form , and ,  .. There was .. one situation ,  She's sleeping . there's this little girl Annalisa . So we can decide about , that doesn't nan  . nan speak a word of English . And every time I try to get her to say anything in English ,  cause I made the whole class learn , like ,  good morning , good bye , can I go to the bathroom , can I stand up , .. can I go to the -- er -- Time to go to the cafeteria , ... and , .. the office , you know , certain st- terms that related to school . ... And she , ... like , .. you know , I tried to get her to say hello , and she'd be like , .. (CHOKE)   None no puedo , no puedo None .  I'd be like , ... yes you can , just say ,    None hello None . Hello Annalisa .   (CHOKE)  That's what she does , she gets real embarrassed , and she just giggles like a goofball  .  Turns bright red . She- she does- -- Well , she would , if- -- You know , if her skin weren't like .. really dark brown , she'd probably be bright red ,  How funny man . you know ? you- You can't really tell when they blush , it's very .. unusual . ... But um , ... her mom , ... like , .. it was a horrible situation , where last week , I wasn't there on Thursday , cause I had to fill out all this , ... stupid n- -- .. n- You know , I had to do all this shit , .. just in order to get my .. position secured there with the bureaucracy , so they let me off for a day .  ... And there was a sub , and , what Annalisa claims , and her mother claims , is that on that day , they brought back the application for free lunch , .. all filled out , .. and that the sub took it . ah . ...  Right ? ... Oh for goodness sake . So , None you know , I find this out a week later . ... I kept bugging Annalisa , t- you know , did you bring the form in , did you fill it all out , why don't you get another one , ... and I search my desk , and it's not there , and I keep calling the office and sending notes , and they keep calling me on the -- their stupid intercom system that you can hardly understand  . Mm , You have to tell .. students , never get .. give a tutor .. anything . ... anything . .. ever . .. Not even homework . They wouldn't let us give homework to the high school ... tutors . I know . because they just , they lose it . They don't care . .. Yeah . ... Well , They- -- They don't give a shit about .. anything . .. I know .  I I .. I hadn't thought of that at th- at that point last week . Let me out of here .  Unless they've just begun ... subbing . Well this woman , because then they're like , .. What are we gonna learn today .  None See I'm originally a .. PE teacher , but ,   I guess I can teach math None ?  You know , they come in with that .. attitude , and they go , .. THUMP I've always wanted to teach math .  Now , what are we on None ? None It's gonna be .. great None .  You know , and you're saying , .. uh , we're on , ... uh , ..  square root of pi ? Uh ,  And they look at you and they go , ... the what ? ..  So they don't know what the hell they're doing . None uh , None pi ? Why don't we go out and run some laps None . I didn't bring any pie with me today . You know ,  they -- They don't know what they're doing ? I don't think we can have pie till lunch , kids .  Yeah . See ? It's like , ... distorted . ... They don't know what they're doing . Well , this .. lady is apparently , an old sub , who , like , all the teachers know , and apparently she's very reliable . .. Ah . So whether the paper got in or not  , I don't know , but um , .. You can't go and ask her ?  ... Well I k- kept calling the office , and saying do you have this ... form , and they'd tell me no , and I finally went in there on Thursday , and I'm like look .  ... Where is it . This kid , you know , she .. most of the time doesn't have money , I have to give it to her myself ,  you know she , she's deprived of lunch ,  do you -- Can- -- Do you have ... a form for her . ... They don't have extra lunches left over at the end of the day that they will give away . w- -- on file . ... no . .. You gotta go in and talk to the principal about this . .. Coop , .. this is .. a raging bureaucracy , .. and there's nothing that I can do . .. I have found that out . When you wait until you hear what th- all they've done with my class , you'll just be disgusted , but , ..  Fourth grade . This girl , ugh . um , ... and so I go in there and I'm like , well can you tell me whether the -- .. the form is on file . .. cause I- I n- -- I realize it takes two to three weeks to process , but just tell me whether it's on file . Because if not , I want her to have another one , now . .. And the woman's like I can't do that , there's a privacy code or whatever , there's a privacy act ,   and I can't access the file . THUMP like , God . what kind of fucking law is that .   that you're gonna tell me , that , you know , this kid might have to wait ,  another month and a half , to e- have any lunch , Because you can't access , .. you know , .. her form ? ...  What's the deal . Unbelievable .  They're just giving -- I think , it sounds , like , to me , they're giving you a lot of shit for no reason . .. Well they really are picking on the fact that I'm new , like , .. y- -- .. uh , It's really annoying . The fact that you're new , uh , .. uh , That I -- I would , .. I would go further than that . I'm not certified . .. And , Yeah ,  it's like , the teachers , and , Coop this last week , can't , First they're like , .. first I only had fifteen kids . right ? .. And the , legally you have to have eighteen . .. HISD rules has it that you have to have at least eighteen . right ?  So I'm the only permanent sub . I'm the only teacher who's not experienced , who's not certified , .. who just started teaching . All these other teachers are old hands , I mean they've all been at it for at , Well Chris is .. the least experienced besides me , but still he's , you know , .. he's had his certification , and he's had a year and stuff , .. he's real good at it .  So , they do shit like , ... first they tell me , like I find out accidentally , from the other teachers . The principal . ... doesn't even tell me . First she hires me n- like , .. the Friday before school starts . ... And expects me to get my room ready , ... and then , ... and then I find out on Thursday , in the first week of school , that I might lose my job . .. Yeah you told me . Come Friday . Yeah . ... and , .. and then , th- .. so I come into class , ... and they've put like , .. all these third-grade students in there . Did I tell you about that ? ... No . ... It's really annoying . what they've done , .. to meet the l- -- the nan .. They split it third and fourth . nan little nan nan technicality that they have to meet , Yeah . They just split the whole thing . Challenging . ... Yeah . it's , .. well , it's something , It's twice as much work for you . it's something for experienced teachers . It's not .. for me . .. You know , it's like really hard for me . .. Because , ... you know , .. and then -- You have to n- -- .. and then , .. That's what I was doing when I was student teaching , I had split fifth sixth . ... Well they didn't even give me any texts , Coop , I mean I was the only .. teacher , in the whole school , who did not have textbooks . You know , Mhm . because they were fucking me around so hard .  ... So then on the- -- on Friday I have eighteen kids , (SNIFF) I'm like great . .. You know . .. .. And all these teachers are coming in and saying , Well , my child is on your role , but I'm gonna keep him in my class . You know .  mm . And I have these three thirdgraders . You know , but the shitty thing is , ... that they .. pick , ... what the teachers do , is they go , oh , well this , .. this kid is bad behaved , I mean he's -- He's really stupid , I'll just send him over to the new  instructor . Of course . ... So they s- -- ... So these are , Of course . the kids that I receive , are the three .. thirdgraders , .. of the lowest ..  education . that nobody wants . ... and the worst conduct . .. Right . .. And so th- -- Meanwhile in the principal's office they're telling me ,    Sorry , I just got a visual ,   Sharon standing in front of the class going , (SCREAM) Aw . Sometimes I'm like that . While these little kids kinda ,  None senorita Flinn None ?  Hee hee hee hee hee .  Oh , THUMP Miss Flinn , Miss Flinn , Miss Flinn None ,  You know , towards the last couple of days I'm like , I put up a list of rules . ... And all day long ,  .. I went back to the rules .  None Do not pull on my clothes None .  And they get up out of the chair ,  and they come up to me , Miss Flinn , Miss Flinn , and I'd walk over by the rules , .. and I'd point to number two . And I'd just look at them .   And they knew what number two was . .. Don't get out of your seat without .. permission .  You know ? So they'd look at me and they'd go , God . ...  they'd go back to their chairs .   On the last day that I was there , like ,  (SNIFF) it was so awful ,  because , Boy . You're a hard ass . I had to become a hard ass None .  The people w- -- All the teachers were telling me , Could be worse . You're too nice , you're too nice , your kids are gonna take advantage of you . And they were . .. Th- they k- -- Yeah . They came to where , .. they'd be talking the whole time , during the assignment ,  Ah .  I'd be up at the board , they'd be TS TS TS TS , I'd turn around they'd go , None ah None . hee hee hee , cause they didn't think I was serious .  And I finally got to the point where , you know , every day , I'd have em put their heads on the table for ten minutes , .. (SNORT) hunh . You know , with the- with their eyes closed , Time out . Quiet time . .. And I finally got to where I withheld recess ? (SNIFF) ... And on the last day , I kept th- four kids after school . ... Yeah . ... You know , but you can only actually keep them over , for like five minutes . Cause they have like buses to catch and stuff , Well , .. I'm telling you , withholding goodies works . Because , ... they'll get kind of surly , I did that . But if you give them rewards , Well I gave them st- -- I gave sticker , .. you know , .. to the k- -- to the kids , and I put excellent ,  and I give stickers to the kids , and the ones that got good grades , that got one hundreds , and ninetyeights , and ninetysixes , I put their papers up on the board . .. Well , there are other things you can do besides um , ... um , .. you know , you can make up goodies . You don't have to spend money on goodies . .. You can have like , .. You can make these little , .. um , .. Do they have a laminating machine in the school ? ... Not in the school , but in this other lovely place . Well , None  None make these little passes or something that say , one --  ... one free lunch with the teacher . .. Or one free lunch to sit with whoever you want at lunchtime . ... I get to sit with my friends at lunch . Or , .. what -- Think up whatever little privileges like that ? ... Um if there's .. anything in the classroom that they really like to do , .. ... have that be a privilege , .. that .. nobody can do , unless they have this pass . And then give those passes out for good behavior at the end of the day . I have an idea . .. Choose the Mister Samuel way of teaching .  Take them by the hair , ..  Boom . Heads against each other .     Or you can walk 2.. up to the chalkboard , and you get really good , so you go and you practice on the weekends . ..  Get chalk from the chalkboard .   And you just None peg None it at their face .  (POW)  You know , I remember . and you -- And you practice . Finally that man was fired , .. man . It took them how many years ? They fired him ? ... Oh , Mister Samuel , He -- k- -- sh- God , He was the most -- Man , he threatened little kids .  We'd all be sitting in a circle , and it'd be current events time , we'd all be sitting there , He was harsh . and one little kid Eli Goodman . ... would ... just .. give him -- ... He was just talking . ... Eli was just talking . Mister Samuel must have had a really bad day .   He came up ,  Alright you little .. shit , ... I'm gonna throw you against this wall . And he threatened it . ... He threatened to throw the kid THUMP against the wall THUMP . And we all heard it , and we all nan ... Went home and told your parents ? nan freaked out .  No . Because w- -- we were too scared . to do anything . ... And we would . And our parents would go , oh he's a great guy . And they'd go and visit him and , he would put on the bullshit , and , ... He'd be fine .  And , .. no one believed the kids . You know ? He was a man , who would walk up to two little boys that were talking , and grab their hair , and ... .. actually bang their heads together . ... What a guy None . He picked Ken Romig up once by the hair , I remember that , Yeah .  , ... Ken , who's like , .. was actually very wellbehaved , you know , and , ... and really art student , ... went on to be one of those overachievers .  You know . ... Just .. yanked him up , by his little blond hairs . By the hair . Yep . We were all like , ... Oh . But he won't do anything to the girls if they give him backrubs . ... That's right . .. That's right .  ... Mister Samuel .. had like , .. the most nan What a jerk , man . nan ... unethical nan nan classroom , I can ever remember , He was a fool . He was an absolute fool . I remember the -- the students -- I remember Muffin being terrified that she was going to be put in his class .  His daughter , His daughter actually admitted it to me . ... I saw Sally Samuel , Admitted what . who is .. pregnant , and has about -- ... You know . .. Let's not discuss it . But , .. I was like , ... Um , ...  What did she admit . None how's your father .   . I was kind of ... crude . ... But I was like , so what is your father doing right now . None Is the man dead yet ?  No .  ... I was just very , kind , she goes , Well , he he got fired , and and I said Oh really now None .  ... That's a surprise . None Que lastima None . And the guy that he .. threatened to throw against the wall , .. was put forward a year . ... Eli graduated a year before I did . See I didn't understand that .  ... It was a hush hush deal . Didn't make nan nan any sense . ... It w- -- It was really weird . Well he'd like , .. Eli's parents probably tried to get him transfered out of his class . His classroom was like , .. And that was the only way to do it . No doubt .  crazy . No doubt . That man was insane . ... Definitely insane .  Hey Coop . ... What I was gonna tell you about , that really frustrates me is that , ... uh , ... that .. the people- .. principal and stuff they say to me , ... Oh , well , .. what you do with those thirdgraders , you know , is you just like , take them , and put them , you know , with one of the arter fourthgraders , who's very verbal , uh . and .. and wellbehaved . And you have them work as a team , you know , so that the fourth-grader can help the third-grader . ... But .. that's bullshit . .. Because , ... that just teaches the thirdgrader , with the lesser intelligence , that , .. that he's worthless , you know , that he can't learn stuff on his own . No it's not . .. No it's not . You can put them in teams like that , but you don't put one with one . You put , like , two fourth-graders with , ... how many third-graders do- -- What's the ratio of third to fourthgraders .  But they're not -- You mean , so they don't feel singled out ? Now I have like five thirdgraders . Or what . I have like t- twenty-two kids . .. Okay , so you have fifteen fourthgraders , and five thirdgraders ? Na- -- ... Uh no . ... I have like seventeen fourth-graders and five thirdgraders . All you have is twelve kids ? ... What ? You only have twelve kids ? No . .. Seventeen nan Oh , okay . nan fourthgraders .  So then what you do is , you sprinkle the fifth-graders out evenly . ... And you make the fourth-grader .. take the responsibility for teaching them . Thirdgraders ? And you engrain in them , that it's their responsibility to help those little kids . That's what I did . I have been .  But , And it works . Can you -- Can you say it's part of your grade ? As long as it's -- Part of your -- None Yes . Oh yes .  corp -- or , .. You bet . What do you call it . Well the thirdgraders , You tell them that their ability to cooperate is being graded . Coop -- ... Well the third are just like , y- -- They're getting a grade in cooperation . you know , except for a couple who -- .. who are real art , ... darn . That would be so hard . feel like , uh , you know , they're incapable . .. I mean th- -- they just feel like  , Well the fourth-gra try and lord it over em too .  and the fourth-graders will try to just like give them the answers . There's nothing else you can do about it . And it's hard for me to keep track of that . .. You know ? I'll be like , Don't give them the answers , Standing over -- I want you to help them understand , but don't just give them the answers None . It takes a long time to teach em how to work together .  I- -- if I can't teach these kids , you know , I go around to the thirdgraders , I try to teach them individually what a noun is ,  It'll start to happen by January Sharon . .. I mean it takes a very long time . It's not easy to do . I'm not gonna be there until January . Have- -- Have you explained to them , like , the speech about , making mistakes is .. part of life , .. that speech , and , (SIGH) what's the other speech . The other speech is , I've given them everything . um , don't give away -- Don't give away the answers , because you're d- denying them of .. learning . .. Mhm , ... If y- -- If you put it to them in a very simple way , and they get it and they kind of go , yeah . Well what you want to do is ,  When you have them in groups working on something , I have , I have . It shouldn't be ... multiple choice . It shouldn't be , ... It isn't . something easy . .. They should -- .. They should have to , Write it out ? have some discussion going on . ... Like ,  .. give them something to work on that there is no answer to . ... But the other fourth-graders it's like , that is just opinion . They'll learn just as much . You know , they don't really wan- -- they don't .. want to help the kids , they -- They wa- -- you know , they're done , and they want to play , and they get upset with me ,  if I expect them to help the thirdgraders ,  help em to learn the basics .  Tough . And , .. they don't have the patience , Too bad . This is the funny one . or the psychology , Yeah , to learn how to teach the kids , Well , when you're subtracting , you bring the one over , and then that becomes ten , and then you have to cross it out , it becomes a nine , God . and then you bring the one over , I couldn't do it . None You know , I couldn't do it . and these -- .. The thing is , ... that the teachers that had these third-graders before , and a lot of the fourthgraders , really failed as teachers , Cause they didn't .. teach them None .. diddly . None jack . They should have learned that in the second grade . ... In the .. in the second grade I learned my times tables . In the third grade I knew th- -- Fourth grade was nan I had them memorized up until twelve . nan fractions . ... I failed . These kids .. can't do their times tables .   The fourth-graders even . Well they've just -- .. You know , They've been , I have one student , you know , who knows his times tables up until ten . Wait-  -- they -- (%) hey , The teachers have just been passing them along  . Wait a minute , neither did I . Yeah . I didn't know them either . ... I didn't know times tables till s- -- .. like fifth grade . Only cause I was a dufus . But , ... Well were -- No , It was because you were a lazy butt . I could not -- I could not do fractions , .. I could not do fractions . .. And I mean with .. Samuel as a teacher , who wants to tell them , ... who wants to go up to this man and say  , I have a problem . .. (GASP) None You didn't really have Mister Samuel , did you ? ... Oh , hell yeah .  Oh , I thought you got out of being in his class . Unhunh . I had him , .. my whole fourth-grade year . .. And then there was a ... possibility the following year , that he was going to teach fifth grade None .  Cause our 2 fifth-grade teacher  was leaving .   So all of us were like ,  shitting in our pants going ,  no ,   please , no . We just -- We lucked out , .. man . But we got Missis Lindberg , who was like , ... the first granola woman I ever met . Granola woman  . (SIGH) .. She would say , CLAP Let's go on a field trip . ... We're gonna go on a hike . . But , .. but to try and .. and talk me out of believing in Murphy's Law , by offering a miracle as a replacement , that doesn't d- work . Well you're right , I think they're probably flip sides . I mean who are you . But I'm -- Pollyanna ? ... Hardly .  Hardly , look where I've come from . ... I mean , .. ... this chapter on heaven an hell , it's really interesting . ... Why , I used to have this , .. sort of , .. standard line , that , ... there were two things I got out of .. my marriage . One was a name that was easy to spell , and one was a nan , .. a child . .. ... That , ... really got me grounded . But , the fact of the matter is , ... that the marriage itself , I mean as hellish as it was , ... .. it's like it pulled me under , like a giant octopus , or a giant , ... giant shark . And it pulled me all the way under . And then , ... and there I was , it was like the silent scream , and then , .. then I found that .. I was on my own two feet again . And it really was -- .. ... .. S- what was hell in that .. that marriage became , ... became a way out for me . ... It was the flip side . .. It's like sometimes you go through things , ... and you come out the other side of them , you .. come out so much better . ... And if I hadn't had that , if I hadn't had --  It's not the way with food . ... What do you mean . ... What goes in one way ,  doesn't come out    .  Kay  ,  comes out very hellish . Yeah . Very hellish . .. So what did that have to do -- But it's so goodgod -- k so good going down . Th , I mean , What did -- there's there's the opposites again . It's it's ma- -- The food is like , all unique , Hey . and wonderful , I- it's major-league Yin and Yang . and heavenly ... major league . .. What does that have to do with heaven and hell in the book . ... Well , ... I'm just sort of reiterating . ... I could read you some . No . I mean is that allowed ? ... No I I don't want to hear anything out of a book with , .. chapter called heaven and hell . You don't . .. No . Nkay . Well then let's talk about our vacation . I'm gonna be closed-minded about it . ... Oh dear . But , That's hell . .. I didn't like the book , the way I -- the minute I looked at it . ... You didn't . No . That's cause you , ... That's because I have my own ideas about it , I guess . That I'm .. pretty comfortable with . ... ah . ... I don't like re- -- I don't like reading books about what other people think about dying . ... And I , .. consider myself a real free thinker when it comes to that stuff .   Well . And that's -- None Remember , remember it in the movie None , in Beetlejuice ? The handbook for the recently deceased ? Yeah ? I mean books , words . I mean , ... n- they just become handbooks . You distill them , and use them in your own way . ... No , ... no , .. no I don't . .. I don't . ... I , ... I come up with my own ideas about that stuff . ... And where do you get the ideas . ... Thought . ... And where do you get those thoughts ? Processing what goes on around me . ... Well ? ... Isn't a book part of what goes on around you ?  Well None , ... more from an oblique source . You know , when you're reading fiction , or , .. or articles , or history or something like that , but .. but , t- for me it's very difficult , to pick up a book about death . .. That someone's written about death , because it's bullshit .  None Well -- Who knows what death is . What -- d- None -- what what this man has put in the boo- -- You haven't read the book , one . You haven't read the book , so you don't know . ... I haven't read the book so I don't know , Yeah but I do know , it it's an awfully , it's it's an awfully presumptuous thing , but  , to sit down and write a book about death , d- -- when you haven't died . It has , it has , it has stories in there from , from the Zen and , .. f- it just pools on other different -- Well the Zen can be bullshit too . None .. different sources . I mean , whoever wrote the book of Zen wasn't dead either . Well None it .. might all be bullshit None ,  but , you g- you g- you've gotta pull these ideas from your environment , and what's gone on before . ... Th- th- the things I know most , about life and death come from .. from .. my grandmother . ... And having gone through all that nan . ... With her . And then it was interesting , cause reading I did after that , substantiated that experience . For two months , prior to her death , did I tell you this ? That she dreamt ? About .. um , ... she had this dream of falling off a building . .. Down o- -- Just like that , .. that cartoon we saw . ... Falling ? .. Yeah , The animation cartoon . yeah .. yeah .. yeah . And it was like that . And that's what she was dreaming about . ... And then she said that she dreamt about , um , .. all of her relatives , ... that had died . ... She wasn't dreaming about anybody who was living , but who had died . ... And I read that later . You know it was much later I read that in a book where , ... um , ... people who .. had .. technically died , and then have been revived . ... Saw .. relatives coming for them . I've read that . Course that may be what happens , .. prior to the big , ... the big nothing . ... So why are you reading a book about dying , ... I don't know . .. you don't know ? .. I have an interest in it . Why . ... You're alive . Why are you reading a book about dying . ... I've always been interested in it . Why . ... I mean , you know , you ask someone why they're interested in electronics , and they can probably tell you . ...  Well , I don't know , I guess it must , fo- some reason , I was fascinated with that movie last night . .. With , ... with uh , Lilian Gish and B ,  and Bette Davis . I couldn't believe .  These two old , ... I don't know , ... I wanna say windbags . ... Ha- but what happens to them , I , here's Betty Davis . I mean , Sarah ? z- yeah -- This incredible ... film legend . ... And we think of her in Jezebel , we think of her , you know , oking .. cigarette oke into the faces of .. William Holden and , and the like . I don't , I've never seen those movies . ... You've never seen Betty Davis movie ? You've heard Kim- -- The song Betty Davis Eyes ? Sure . ... And she's got , she got , the woman's got a rep . And so she .. she lives , and , Yeah . I guess it's j- looking at my mother , too , I n- -- ... What does that have to do with why you're reading a book on death ?   .. I've always been interested in death . ... Why . Why ,  ...  yeah I'm laughing . What is -- I'm thinking one thing my mother always used to say , when I wouldn't go bicycling with my father , Pamela , you are  , she would say , you are   -- she would say , you'll be sorry when we're dead . Because you wouldn't bicycling ?  Mm  . Because I wouldn't go bicycling with my father . Oh . So i- w it's it's -- You know , and I h- -- I bit my tongue the other day , because remember , .. you said to Deven , well , I really want to spend time with you ? Yeah ? And then we went to the Chalk .. Fair , and then he took off with Tobias ? The Chop Fair ? The Chalk . Oh , The Chalk Fair . .. unhunh ? And he took off with Tobias ? Yeah ? ... Is that , that , .. that .. I wanted to say with him well your dad wanted to spend time with you today . ... And why did you run off . ... And I didn't , because I remembered , ... that my mother tried to guilt me the same way . ... So that's why you're interested in death ? ... Maybe it's because my parents were old ? When I was young ? Very very young ? ... I've always , ... thought it's weird , that we've been -- ... I look down at my body ? ... And I feel like I'm in a spaceship . ... Yeah ?  None  None  I just , That's why you're interested in death ?  n- and ,  I just think it's so damn weird we're here . ... Yeah ? ... Yeah , well it is . And , and I was constructed , ... inside of some woman's womb , ... and I was ... burped out ,  So  , so you're running , you're running down the road , all the way to the very end . Hunh ? ... N- you're you're you're already standing at the end of the road ,  .. trying to figure out what happens there ? None Well , n- n- -- Maybe I -- maybe I'm just eager to get back to where I was . May- -- Back into the womb ? No no no , I -- maybe , .. maybe this whole lifetime was just a really rude interruption . Of what ,  of what  , Of whatever it was  I was doing , before I was , before my number came up . ... And I was told I had to come back here . ... What if . What .. if . Unhunh . What if worrying about that , See , this is what you told Deven . well , what if worrying about that , has got in the way , ... gotten in the way , of you making positive choices for yourself in your life . ... Instead of just worrying about , w- that you're here , ... and making the best out of it . ... Being here is , .. is so illusive sometimes . ... I mean .. illusionary . ... Those are two different words , and they mean two different things . Well it's illusionary . ... I take back what I said about illusive ,     Y- .. you may be elusive , ... well , Mm , yeah but .. but .. but , to me the whole point is is , ... you have no idea , what happens before or after . ... You have no idea . ... You can read books about it , and you can .. talk about it , ... but the most pragmatic thing to do is , to just ... live it . ... Hm . ... Learn the rules of the game , ... play the game , For what . ... for whatever you want . ... For whatever you want . ... Be a doctor , or a screen writer , or an actress , or a philanthropist , or an explorer ? ... An explorer . ... Do what you want , with the time you have . Learn , ... give , ... whatever . ... Love ? Love ? None Love ?  Could I love you ?     Could I love you while I'm here ? .. ... Don't make light of what I'm saying . ... No . ... Think about the kids . What are -- who are , who are these kids . ... Who are these kids . ..  ... These little seedpods , ... that have been sent our way .  ... Well , .. sometimes for me , they are a whip and a hairshirt .  None  None They're little , .. little , ... little lessons .  ... .. Yeah , ah , yeah I mean , sometimes I have to be real prep- -- (GASP) .. What .  , Natalie asked me about Santa Claus today . What did she , what did she say , In the laundromat . She said , .. mom , Santa Claus isn't , ... I mean , d- is there a for real Sa- Santa Claus ? .. I said a for real Santa Claus , you mean a man who lives .. at the north pole ? .. She said yeah , I said no . ... And she said , well , who are the other ones . I said well , they're the spirit of Santa Claus , and , ... they represent Santa Claus . They -- they're a picture of Santa Claus . They're Santa Claus's agents . ..  They're pictures of Santa Claus . ... Is my mike on . Unhunh ? Oh , Okay .  It sure is ,  And , you just damn near broke the damn needle there ? and then she said , ... and then she said well , who fills the stockings . ... And I kind of , I said , ... love fills the stockings . Oh God , Pamela .  She said , she said , oh you mean , ... adults ? ... Adults who wanna show you how much they care , and I said , ... yeah . Adults , adults around who love you . ... Fill those stockings . ... And I said , she said but some adults talk about Santa Claus , I said that's because , .. they wanna believe in Santa Claus . And that's what I told her , I said , I wanna believe in Santa Claus . .. In fact sometimes I do believe in Santa Claus . ... And that , ... that really satisfied her .  None But I thought it was very pragmatic of her to ask about that in June . Yeah but what d , I thought to myself , if she asked me that , like , on Christmas Eve , well she must have gotten some sort of a signal somewhere . MIC Today in the laundromat ? I mean what does that have to do with death . ...  ... Well , .. we were talking about .. death and illusions , the illusions of this life , .. you know , I -- .. I , I ,    , None my favorite word when I was twelve , ... was paradox . ... Why . Because , ... I thought , .. any word , ... that was defined . .. I mean I remember the definition . .. That I learned in seventh grade . .. That was paradox . .. Seemingly contrary . ... Seemingly None    None . Seemingly con , and I had a hard time with the definition . .. So I thought .. God . A word . .. That I'm supposed to learn , and I get this definition , and I don't even understand the definition . The definition of the word paradox , is by design ambiguous . ... Chew on this one . An ambiguous paradox . ... Is that redundant ? Yes .  (GROAN)    (GROAN) None  None ... Well , .. that was age twelve . .. So nan , that was very close to Deven's age , when , ... I sort of , .. bit my teeth into that one . Bit your teeth , hunh ? And then , yeah .  As I went ,   I ,  took a bite ? Is , is that like cutting it in the nip  ?   ... I , I get a little ahead of myself  .   Yeah I guess you do  .   Oh God I hope this doesn't all sound real stupid .     ... Well . .. From , .. from twelve to seventeen , then , ... that went from paradox , ... to , ... the invisible , .. interfacing with the visible . ... Hunh ?  The invisible . ... interfacing with the visible . Facing  nan For everything you see . You can look at me and I'm a body . You see eyes , ... you see .. body , you see hair , you see ,   S- get your hands off me  .   You see all those things , right ? None Yeah None . But there's there's me , inside . .. That's ... invisible . ... It's not , ... it's it's n , it's it's , I mean , what if , what if you took the same ... spacesuit ? ... And you put another spirit into it . ... It would be a different person , It'd say , let me out  . ((LAUGHTER) ((LAUGHTER) It would be , .. a different person . ... You're right . I wouldn't be me . Right . That's right . It'd be a different personality .  So .. I , .. I , ... I think it's , very fascinating , Of course that's a hypothetical , how do you know that .  it's very interesti- -- Maybe , may ,  maybe ,  maybe , maybe the spacesuit has something to do , with , .. with who's inside of it . .. I mean you don't know that .   Wouldn't that be f- a fascinating experiment . None Well no , because look . .. Genes . .. Genetic makeup . .. It's proven . .. And that's part of the spacesuit , if you wanna use that . ... That that your genetic makeup , .. largely determines who you are . .. You mean .. the chemical bath I sit in ? Yeah . ... As it were . .. ... Hm . .. Sort of dictates how I feel about being in .. this spacesuit . Yes . Yes right . .. R- you know , and it depends on your brain dolphin level , and ,  My brain dolphin ,    , mm , that's sweet . ... you know ? Hunh . I- depend am , yeah . Yeah . ... A lot of it has to do with the with the , .. the r -- ... five dollars and ninety-eight cents worth of chemicals and compounds that make you . ... We could spend a lot of our life , trying to , to contradict that . Why . Well , Because ,   it may be  a very bad chemical bath .   We may , (SNIFF) b- been put into something that's completely acid , to our TRUE essence . .. Yeah , but we have no choice in that matter . And we spend a lifetime , ... that's right . ... N- well , no apparent choice . ... No choice , ... that we know of . ... Mn yeah . ... Hm .. hm .. y- .. yeah . ... But but rather than than , ... I mean I'm not , .. I'm not , ... I'm not all bent out of shape about it .   But I've just , but I was thi- -- 3  You're just really interested in death  . My yearning , my yearning ,  my yearning is n- -- .. maybe not to run ahead and ,  .. and , ... and , and get to the exit . As -- . W- -- I mean maybe it's the yearning nan , .. for where I was before I was born . Well how is write- -- reading a book written by some schmuck , who thinks he's an expert on death , Well he may or may not be a schmuck , Darryl . ... Anyone who sits down to write a book about death , .. with the hopes of enlightening , his fellow human beings , .. is in my book a schmuck . ... Well now , ... them's fightin' words ,  boy None .  You could  --  Who the hell is someone , .. anyone , who's living , to sit down  and write a book about death . ...   Now really . You know ? It's like , it's these -- .. this -- this is the .. person who falls under that .. that , .. category of expert that I disdain so much . ... I know a lot about- --  Maybe he's a very old soul . .. ... Please . Like Old King Cole  nan  ((LAUGHTER) ((LAUGHTER) Hm . ... Well , If he's a very old soul , he should keep it to himself .  you know , ... I felt l- after Gretchen died , it was all .. rather unfair . I mean , the tides at work , ... just swept over her so quickly . ... And it was like , But really not so quickly , it was , yeah , I mean , it was something that had started in her a very long time ago . ... She was gone in less than , ... five months . .. Six -- Eight months . ... ... And it just , ... amazes me . I mean , you can't drag on and on and on about a fellow creature who's gone , ... but I still miss my grandmother . ... And I , ... I certainly miss my dog . ... I just think it's so weird , that they're gone . ... And where did they go to . . Disgusting .  Well you know , remember Tyke ? .. Lived next door to Mom ? .. ... Yeah . ... Okay . .. Two weeks ago I'm watching TV , .. and David Horowitz is going to have , this former car .. radio thief on ? ... It's her boyfriend ? .. Yeah , her exboyfriend . ... Mike . ... He's the one that stole Hector's radio . ... How do you know . Well , ... cause well , .. he -- .. he was a cocaine addict . So he's talking about , he -- you know he's , yeah man , he's gonna show us , .. you know , how  not  , to protect your car , not to get it , you know , ripped off man . Cause , you know , I -- .. yeah , I was into it , uh let me show you how easy it was . He's actually pretty intelligent . .. You know he just -- ... uneducated , so , .. um , .. yeah . Hector's radio , with -- I- it was broken , we were gonna s- -- take it out and send it back to the factory , to get a new factory , .. radio , we never got a chance , because , the back window was broken , and they stole it . ... The radio . ... And you can't send something back to the factory , that isn't there anymore , None  None right ? .. So he never got his radio . It's really hard .  None Oh . Shit None . So he got another radio this summer ,  but of course that got ripped off also . But never mind . He's having bad luck with that car . What i- what i- what is this . .. I don't know . .. So -- .. You- -- .. Y- it's obvious now that this guy w- -- This was the one who stole .. Hector's , I mean , .. nobody came out and told you , guess what ,  I confess . Oh , we knew . .. We knew . .. We figured it had to be Michael . SIP ... Oh .. shit . .. Mhm . ... ... So Mom didn't want me to -- We had to go see Jan last Sunday ? .. at her house for dinner ? And- -- or breakfast ? And Mom said , .. n- you know , don't bring it up to Linda , don't tell her about Mike . So I- I- b- -- ...  That's like  waving a  red flag  . Yeah , hello Tyke , did you see Mike on TV ?  Did she ? Yeah . ... She said , sh- they were sitting there watching TV , and the next thing she know , there's Mike . on the -- .. on TV . And she goes , .  ... And of course John , who's just as bad , is sitting there going , oh , did you see Mike , your ex-boyfriend ? But he's no better . ... He does other goofy things .  .. Goofy . Yeah . None A little goofy None None . Graft . Goofy .  I know . Hee . Sleepy None  None  .  steali- -- Stealing cars , 5.. but , 5.. you know , it's okay . 5.. At least it's not car radios , it's the whole car .  It's the whole car .  Go big , or don't go at all .  Shoot   .   I know it   . .. I know .  It's amazing . .. No , Jan talked the whole time , in a voice like this .  None Hi Mar Alina , Alina I'm so happy to see you .   None None 2 And we're going 2 ,  3 God , .. turn the volume down   , .. let me out of here .  2 And I kept  ,  looking over at Mar ,  and she's going ,              cause she didn't wanna go ,  and I she --  I said , Mom , SLAP we gotta go , so we never have to go again , right ?  So , well at least we had a good time Saturday , we went to see Oba Oba . ..  You know , Ruben loved it . They kinda -- Ola Ola , what'd he call it ? Oba Oba ? .. That -- What -- He -- Oh , he called it Oho Oho .   They ca- -- .. They came and grabbed everybody , and got you dancing in the aisles , .. and they were just nice people None .  They were really happy to be doing it .   One of the g-  -- The male athletes were incredible , but one of the guys , his entrance , on- -- .. on to the stage  is he , comes sliding across on his head . ... And Hector , of course , looks over at me and goes ,  .. I couldn't do that Lina , .. otherwise I'd have no hair left .       But there was hardly anybody there . None  None It was the matinee , the place was completely empty . ... Really .  .. That's why Marcia and Jim could get up and move .   They -- They thri- -- They feed off of all these --  Th- .. the friend that was there with them , is this older guy with this young chick . ... And she was like a real pill , you know ,  she's sitting there , with this hair pulled back , in a little ponytail .   And she's like sitting there and , he said , I would have been here , but she was so late . And getting her any place on time , she's going , well , I had to get ready . .. I don't know why .    Nothing was gonna help her . No makeup , no nothing . Cause she's the little girl , and he's the older man , and he's taking care of me None .  ... God ,  It sounds like the tape I made last night , and these guys .. start talking about , (SNIFF) .. you know , some , .. you know , .. she's so vulnerable . SIP  She's probably like twentysix , .. and she looks thirteen , and it's just so ,  it's like , what did -- They said something like , you know what , (SNIFF) .. it's the butterfly , you can't catch None --      And I'm like , I'm trying not to vomit ,  listening to this  . Give me break .  Give me a break  .  That stupid little bitch . She just married daddy to take care of her .  (GULP)   .. They all live down like in Del Mar ? ...  w- Super ritzy area .  I know . What about uh ,   What . Th- the other L Perrizo in this world . Oh , Liza ? Oh , God .  Well- -- t- like -- ... Did I tell you , about when Mom was having Arnold and Lisabeth over for lunch , finally . ... Okay , well , .. Mom -- .. They call up in August , and go , .. I mean it's , .. Daddy's been dead what , seven years , and finally it dawns on Lisabeth , that she doesn't see Mom that much . ... Well , it's cause she n- -- .. I know , she never calls her , right ?  So Mom -- (GULP) She just goes , I feel like you've got a whole other world outside of us , like you don't even need us Mar , and that you have a whole other life . Mom said I do . ..    Well ,  Poor Lisabeth . you've hurt my feelings , and buh .  Mom's go- -- Maybe she's just kind of dense . Hunh , .. Well , .. she wants everything on her terms .  You know . Is she vicious or dense . .. She's a dope .  So ,  Explains that  .   Exactly  .  So , t- Mom said , you know , she goes , when can I see you . .. Or- -- So Mom said ,  well my next free day's like October fourth . So that was when ,  they set up two months in advance to have lunch . So October fourth rolls around ,  and Liza had to go do something , so they're stuck babysitting Cassandra . ... Great . .. You know , just your big thrill in the world , How old is she now . this little piss ass . .. Four , five , some place around there , I can't remember . .. ever . Cause it's just -- .. She's such a nightmare to me .  So , .. anyway , Mom -- They had to cancel , they m- -- they make arrangements , for like .. couple weeks later , ... and I wanted to surprise Mom , and bring over some nice pastries from La Conversation . So I go into La Conversation , and I picked out all this stuff for Uncle Arnold . And it was just supposed to be Mom , Ruben , Arnold and Lisabeth . And I was gonna sit down and talk with them and split . So I'm driving up to the house , ... and there's a car in front of me , and the guy is just like sitting there , in the middle of the road , and he's not moving , and , .. you know I wanna park the car .   you know , and th- -- there's no .. parking either , on one of those sides , because it's street sweeping day , or something , it's like , .. Would you move , so I can come park my car . And then I realized , it's Liza and Antonio .   And there's Cassandra , jumping around , jumping around , jumping around , inside the car . nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah .   So it turns out , that , she wouldn't get out of the car with Arnold and Lisabeth , so Liza and Antonio followed them over there , to pick up Cassandra , and take her for a day in the park . ... But then Liza wanted Antonio to see Mom's house . .. So they go barging in on Mar . .. So Mom felt obligated , to ask those two idiots to lunch . ..  Also , thereby , having to invite , dear Cassandra , who we did not want there in the first place , cause she's such a little piss ass . .. So the first thing , I get inside the house , and there's Cassandra , jumping up and down . Jump , jump , jump , jump , jump , jump , jump . And I grabbed her , and I held her down ,  and I go ,  listen you little piss ass , .. this is my house , and today you are not going to jump . Today you're gonna act like a human . You got that ?    She just looks at me ,  she kind of nods her head , None 3 She's terrified   . and she's going , None Ah , shit .  Auntie Lina's here again , .. I am leaving .  So she wants to go out on the balcony ,  I grab her again , and I go ,  no kids on the balcony . You wanna go outside ? You gotta go downstairs , (YAWN) but you're not going out on the balcony . .. Cause knowing you , .. you're gonna fall off .  Aw ,   wouldn't that be a pity  .  Oh , I know  . So and ,  f- for Arnold and Lisabeth , of course I said , .. Cassandra , ... you wanna play one bounce off the balcony ?  .. Hunh . ... t- Auntie didn't laugh . .. The little shit .  She wouldn't eat her lunch , because she wanted dessert . ... Dessert comes around , .. Mom had cut all the pastries in half ? .. Cassandra takes five of them . .. She took .. a bite , .. from each one . .. That was it . .. I don't want any more None . Cause she gets away with it . ... Gets away with it . She was taking the silverware , and digging it into the table . .. Oh , that's cute .  I said , .. excuse me , .. Cassandra ?  You wanna try that one more time ? Th- 2.. those tables are museums , could you please , ..  chill out in the uh art k-  -- .. art work here .  I said try it again . One more time , I'm gonna come over there ,  and I'm gonna take that , and I'm gonna dig it into you .  ... And meanwhile ,  Lisabeth's going  ,   None maybe Cassandra wants to go outside again .  And I said , yeah , that's a good spot for her .  .. .. Antonio had on white shoes .  ... I'm sorry . I don't care if he is Italian ,   I don't care . ... That was the .. ugliest set of shoes I ever saw in my life . ..     .. One of the kids at work said ,  but Alina it doesn't count , unless he had a white belt . .. CLAP .. CLAP  .. And he did None None . He did  .  I don't care if it's a white suit ,  ... put something else  --   He had on a white suit , Liza had on a um , .. a black suit , and then he stands there and tells her how it's not -- .. it needs to be baggier here , and they're analyz- -- They are so superficial ,  They are into all this clothing . He has a 2.. restaurant or something , or what does he do ,  or wh- -- Who is he . He's a waiter . .. He's a waiter at Rosa's . out there in Ontario .  which is a very nice restaurant I'm sure , but , .. he wants to open his own restaurant someday , and he thinks , .. we're gonna finance it . .. ... Actually thinks Cathy and Jawahar are , or , .. Jonathan is , cause they're the wealthy ones  , I tried to explain to Cathy that , ...  .. life had changed now . (SNIFF) (GULP) ... ... for her , that -- and that there were- nan , .. gonna be , .. all sorts of , .. .. parasitic ... relatives ... distant or .. whatever . (GULP) Like Jonathan ? 3.. coming up and saying ,   Did she tell you about Jonathan ? ... Yes . ... Trying to get him a job ?  .. Oh yeah . Well , then see that's another thing . ... She doesn't understand it . .. Well , Tommy Spencer .  None Well why None .  Alin- -- Uh .. Cathy , don't you understand that , .. you know , things are different now , you have this ... mega house , .. and uh , you know , you have this  ,  you know , things are different . But they --  they th- -- the- -- they kind of thrive on that . They like having people having to owe th- -- That's part of the reason they're not burning their bridges , right ?   .. So , To where .   That is a great line   . To where . Is that hilarious . That's .. typical Thompson . .. He is so funny .  But um , my husband . ... Not your professor . Um ,  No . .. For this stupid New Year's Eve party then ,  .. Tommy Spencer , .. who's up there , who y- .. was Jonathan and Loren's best friend , right ? He ,  opens his big mouth to Jonathan , that Cathy and Jawahar are having this party . So Cathy calls me up , and she wants Jonathan's ph- .. address . And I go , for what . ... She goes well we have to invite him to the New Year's Eve party .  And I go why . .. She goes well Tommy Spencer opened his big mouth . And I said , oh . .. So you're going to host them are you ? ... She goes what do you mean , host them . I said if you invite them up there for a party , .. they're gonna assume , that they are staying with you , right ? ... She goes no they're not . nya . And I said , well that's what they're gonna think . .. And I said , if you invite them , you'll also have to invite Liza and Antonio . You want them staying at the house too ? ... So next thing you know , they dropped -- At least that bridge , they weren't too unhappy about burning . Hm , God .  .. But Keith and Sally , those two b .. drips , the one that told me I was shoveling my food , and I didn't need a fork ,   um ,  They're friends with this other friend of theirs , and they're trying to None --  .. Th- th- -- That they don't talk to anymore , and I mean , Campbell's a .. cocaine user , abuser , dealer , that's all he does . Campbell's a lawyer . ... You know , he's just , ... no good . So , ... he- --  They're trying to , b you know , .. have them be friends again . ... Well what .. what for , Cathy . ... Why are you gonna go -- .. They were gonna go to this dinner party ,  Saturday night , .. to see them , I go , what are you gonna do that for . ... Who cares .  ... Does she have any friends you think ? No . up there ? ... No . ... Why . .. Cathy -- She's not a good friend herself . Jawahar's a really nice guy .  ... He is a nice guy . He is , but , .. he doesn't understand how to mix friends at all . .. We already went through that . When I first got back from Italy , and I was up there , (GULP) .. he -- we were friends with this one Australian guy , .. and he was friends with this other .. idiot from New Zealand , Dennis . And one night , he figured , oh , both part of the same world . You know , f- New Zealand , Australia . So he invited Doctor Spargo out with Dennis . Well I didn't get along with Dennis at all , he was a jerk . .. I did not like him . ... Period . And Spargo was okay . .. And we go out , ... and ,  .. or we went out , .. and these guy- -- ... they were at each other's throats , the whole ... night ... long . ... Competition .. galore . ... Really . .. Oh yeah . .. Each one was fighting for our affections . None ... That was very apparent . I knew that was gonna happen . Plus they didn't like each other . Spar- -- Well Spargo was older , ... you know , and he was real bright , and he knew that this guy was a jerk . ... If we went to parties , and there was somebody who came up to try to talk to us , he'd keep em away . ..  Just like a little t , um , Australian sheep dog . ... Running around . .. rar rar rar rar rar rar None .   All this protective stuff going on . MIC ... It was a lot of fun .  .. Whoops , ... I'm sorry , MIC  knocked me off . ... MIC But , ... Cathy and Jawahar don't understand how to mix their friends at all . MIC ... They don't understand , that it's also okay , .. not to have .. everybody MIC at the same party . ...   Is she working , You can't . or doing anything .  No , she works for Jawahar ,   but ,   you know ,  so then um , What does this mean  . SIP Well , she answers phones , Wasn't she -- She said she wanted to go back to school , or something , do something with her life , or , she's too into computers .   ... They're boring .   You know , aren't they boring , they're so boring .   I mean it's like , who cares .   No offense , but I think that you can get .. caught up in computers , like , within , what .  Five weeks or something ?    2.. You gotta sit there , and , you you know , oh you -- you space out on it . She's like talking about ROM , and .. RAM , and , .. you know , (SNORE) (SNORE) and she --  I know  .  She's passionate about it .  I'm like  , None I can't relate . Leave me None alone . I can't relate at all ,  I just -- I don't care . .. I really don't care . I -- This party I went to Friday night , where Joy was jamming on that harmonica ? That was absolute- -- Well first of all , it's paddlers . And I thought , oh , it's going to be boring , I don't wanna go , Hector wouldn't go . .. He said , I'm working late Lina . You go if you want . Okay sweets , I'll go if I want . And I don't -- .. Joy I like . ... Cause she's really interesting . .. But a lot of those other paddlers are idiots . ... I did not wanna go . ... So I walk in , she's changing apartments , she's moving into her own condo . I walk in , and the first hint that there's -- this is gonna be something a little bit unusual , is there's all these helium balloons ? .. ut- -- .. up at the ceiling ? .. With  uh metallic colored streamers coming down , three streamers , each balloon , I mean the whole ceiling is just packed with these helium balloons . It was so much fun . .. So I walk in and I see , .. two of the .. paddlers I definitely don't wanna see .  One of which had a Halloween party , I told her we're coming , we show up , she'd already left for another party . .. I said why the hell didn't you tell me you were leaving . Oh , well I thought you'd , .. you know , m- I didn't think you were coming Alina . I said if I say I'm showing up , I show up . We had to go some place for Hector's work first , you know , The Wonder Years . .. where I got insulted , by this other little assistant twat , who since has been fired , thank God None . .. But anyway , .. um ,  then , .. you know , we showed up there and they were all gone . .. That really irritated me . ... You know ? ...   -- .. What do you mean , .. yes , .. ha- -- .. I'm having a party , come and you show up , and there's nobody there .   But anyway ,  um ,  she's sitting there , and this other girl , who's always None nyah nyah nyah None .  .. So I have this pair of suede pants that I got , you've seen them probably ninety million times . I got those from Sak's Fifth off , they're men's .   You know there's nothing great about those pants ,  and they're filthy . And there's parts in them , you know ,  where -- I mean they use substandard stuff ,  so there's (%) -- .. you know , these goofy little white None spots None , and everything , and they're going , .. oh , Alina , you look so chic ,  in your suede pants . And I'm going , oh , yeah , real chic . You know , my hair's dirty , I have it pulled back in a pony tail , I know I look lovely .  .. So I'm sitting there talking to these idiots for a while ,  Then , .. this new wave of people comes in .  ... And these three guys walk in and , one guy , ... was so geeky , he's in a suit . ... Who the hell do you know , goes to a party in a suit . I mean who .. is this geek . So anyway , the .. other guy had a real nice shirt on , and then there was some other geek . So the guy with the nice shirt .. came in , and started talking to me , and he t- his name's like Billy Mulholland , or something , and he's um , from Bakersfield originally , and Joy's father had hired him to- -- .. to sell , or Joy had actually hired him to sell jewelry , .. in Hawaii . .. from her father's store . But now he's .. sells .. vreal estate in Malibu , ... and he's got a painting con- contracting whatever , .. and , one of the things that they're doing , .. is um , ... is painting this building on Melrose , so it looks like you can see through the wall , cause there's , you know , .. plastic first , and then , this stuff behind it or whatever it is . But his renditions of homosexuals , .. I thought .. I was gonna die . .. And I -- I hadn't -- .. you know , .. I just looked at him . .. He was going on and on , about , how these guys , at his work , cause he's down there supervising work , and he looks out and these guys , and he starts talking about their G-strings are showing through their tight leather pants , and  , he was just going on and on and on . And I was getting hysterical . I was laughing so hard , and I just finally looked at him , and I said , hey , I never even thought .. about it . .. Because I grew up in the Swish Alps . You know ?   .. We have been here our whole lives , and I said I never knew anybody who was in the closet , because as far as I'm concerned they've always been out of the closet . Well he couldn't handle this . That I actually knew gay people . He walked away from me .  God .  So  --  (COUGH) (COUGH) The next guy that comes up and starts talking to me is the guy in the suit , (GULP) and it turns out he's from Georgia , Atlanta Georgia , and he's talking away to me , and he- his name is DR . ... And I said , oh , like doctor ? .. And he goes exactly right . .. He's a thoracic surgeon ,  or some .. horse manure ,  but ,  meanwhile , it's just like , this -- .. right here in my face . And I kept backing up , backing up , None and he's right here in my face ,   and he keeps staring at my chest , and it's like ,  You know , fuck you , asshole , why don't you look at my None face .  5 Oh shit  .  But he didn't believe me I was married .  I kept t- -- He's talking about how we should carry on a conversation later ,   and I'm going , no , no , I said I don't -- You know I really don't think my husband would appreciate that .  .. I said , you know , it's a little difficult having three in the same bedroom .  .. A- -- .. You know , at least that's not my shtick . But um ,   he's --  .. he didn't believe me . .. That I was married . .. He thought I was giving him the brushoff . .. That's cool . So they had their other friend come over and meet me , who's a lawyer . And it's really bizarre , cause I guessed all of their ages , and they were like .. blown away . They were saying , well that's what happens when you're this ... elderly age . .. But um , ... meanwhile , .. in had walked these two really s- -- .. kind of scruffy looking guys , you know not -- .. Cause these guys were all  like nan , you know , Mister Hip None  . And here comes these two other guys . One's a Black guy , ... and one's this uh .. White guy with this beard . Uhoh . And he's got like a Lorimar .. sweatshirt on .  So I'm sitting there and -- the --  D- -- Lorimar . DR kept trying to talk to me ,  talk to me , you know -- DR , .. DR doctor . He is a doctor . Yeah but that's all he'd give his name for .  None Oh , But , God None . he's 2.. had an ... interesting command of the English language , because all double entendres . ... You know , but if you didn't understand your English , you didn't understand what he was saying ,  so he was actually a lot of fun to stalk to .  I had a good time with him . That's actually even , b- how we even started talking . .. And he started talking to one of the other paddlers , who's k- probably going through a divorce this year , ... and he used the same lines on her , and she didn't get it .  ..  Oh well .  So you know ,   he was like .. really bored and left . But anyway ,  I started talking to the Black guy . ... when DR walked off , and -- nan you know , all of a sudden you're .. realizing , this guy is stringing sentences , .. complicated sentences together , .. and -- .. y- he knows what you're talking about , and , he's dropping , .. literary terms , and names , and you're kind of going , ...  where are you from . He's a -- He's a .. army brat . ... And has -- .. He speaks fluent German . ... He's lived in about thirty places . .. And I said God , you know , that must have really made you -- d- .. you know , it's -- .. you must have a .. good time at making new friends , it's easy for you , and he said , oh yeah , he had that , but , also what it'd done , is it caused him to be introverted , ... so he read a lot . when he was a kid . ... So he's really self taught , and , you know , .. kind of , one of the things he did was he , .. kind of took up the guitar at twelve ? .. Now he's thirtyfive , you ought to hear that guy on the guitar . He's absolutely amazing . The guy with the beard , was his good buddy . They both work for the phone company . The guy with the beard must be about , .. six four , six five , ... and uh , he got his first degree in fire science . .. His parents were -- His mother was forty-eight when he was born . His father was fiftyone . They died when he was thirteen , .. He put himsel- -- He k- graduated from high school early , went through fire science .. major at UCLA . I forgot , the people from the West Side do that a lot . .. They go through this stupid fire science major out at UCLA . Become firemen .  And now he- -- You know , and now he works for the phone company , and he's -- .. he's uh , .. putting himself , He's going to be a microwave engineer . (GULP)  ... And he's going to CSUN , because that's the only place you can go at night . ... Wow . .. Brilliant . He's been in there since nineteen eighty , Hunh . I'm sitting there , .. you know , he's like thirty now ,  ... talking to him , .. he had a big old hicky here , he told me he was going to another party , I said , oh , you want a matching set ?  Oh God  .   The Black guy laughed  . He goes ,   None oh , you noticed . (COUGH) I said , yeah , turtlenecks don't hide everything . ..   ... But the Black guy's father works with the um , .. CIA . .. Oh , you're kidding  . So ,  no .  He set up , so the Black guy set up all the phones during the Olympics ,   and he was the best like guy out there at the Olympics , or , you know , he had g- special coverage , and special protection , and everything . Wow . But they were so much fun to talk to . .. I had a ball . ... I ended up , .. you know , and -- .. all the paddlers were going , yeah , Alina , talking to all the boys . Don't they know you're married ? .. Are you -- they said ,  .. like I told DR , .. just cause I'm married , I ain't dead .    ... I still like to go to parties . .. I'm sorry  .     Shit .  And he goes  ,   So you're married . And I said , yeah I'm married . And I said , so is he . .. He's married too .  And he goes  , ... oh . ... Well that makes it convenient then , uh , I always like it when , both .. of you .. are married to each other .  2 And I said , .. so do I  .  ..  Hector .  SIP ... Oh God . .. Poor little Hector . .. He's been having a hell of a time . .. Pulling his hair out . He's been grumpy for three months . ... Well , it's over now ,  isn't it ? Yeah . .. He was actually talkative tonight . when I called him on the phone ? .. He talked to me . for like fifteen minutes tonight . Do you know how long it's been since he's been able to k- talk to me on the phone ? Who does he work with now .  ... Kevin . Rosenblum . Ke nan .. No . .. Uh well , yeah .  Rosenblum's down the hall , and then it's -- Kevin's his assistant , and then .. they don't have the third editor . ... But it's so nice . .. Him and Kevin .  Essentially . .. Yeah . .. Yeah None . .. Kevin's his assistant . .. But they're trying to get Kevin to -- Kevin's been in production before . He's has actually been associate producer before . And they want Kevin to take 2.. Hector's place ?  That's a possibility , but Jake will block it . .. Otherwise known as None Nixon None . Who's gonna take Hector's -- ..   Who's gonna  -- Nix , .. nix it . Nixon .  None Nixon None .  .. So ,  uh , who's gonna take Hector's place . .. It- -- .. I don't know . They'll have to see . They gonna .. bring in some , ..  neurotic from New Jersey ?   Yeah sounds like a good idea .  Somebody that could sit there and take orders , and listen to what they have to say , and how they wanna do it . .. Part of the problem with this whole thing was , that uh , how I see it , was that Ellen was not relinquishing t- her duties , to let Hector go ahead and run it , Jake was feeling threatened , sc- because , associate producer is supposed to run editorial . .. And b- it makes sense . Hector .. had an Emmy . .. nomination , .. I would let him run editorial . I would let him do anything he wanted to do in editorial . They clipped his wings . They wouldn't let him do anything . ... There are three shows in trouble . .. He was not allowed to help on any of em . ... None of em . ... That's changed now though , he can be , .. like he was before again ,  Yeah . edit , and the neurotics are out .  Well , what's gonna happen , that he is editorial . Period . Cause st- Stevie's supposed to leave in February , so unless they f- -- .. they -- .. They have to look for an editor . Rosenblum's coming back though isn't he . .. I don't know what he's gonna do . ... He wants to work actually features . He doesn't really wanna do TV .  Hm . .. I went and saw their house the other night . ... Where is it . Their new house .  .. It's um , you know where Beverly Glen is ? (GULP) .. It's one of those streets off of there .  .. It's a nice little -- North , .. or south , .. of Sunset . ... Oh , south , of course . Way down .  Oh . They're right off of Pico and , .. I know . ... How crass . ... TRUE cuz None . But it's in- -- Right next door is Ted Rich , who's uh , .. one of the biggies at MTM , .. or , Lorimar or MGM , .. oh I forgot which one .   One of them .  One of those places . It all means the same to me .  You know , really . I can never tell the difference .  MTM , MGM , Lorimar , Except one day ,  Hector was s- -- you know , they were scoring ? .. the .. show last week ? And I -- .. and I called up to talk to him ,  and , I could hear the um , ... the musicians in the background tuning up their instruments ?  And then , .. you know , and it's okay to talk to Hector , I could .. hear him a little bit , but not too well , but you know I still could talk to him , and the next thing you hear , all these horns blaring . So he said , Lina , I have to go . No shit .  I can't hear you at all ,  sweetheart  . ..  Call me , when I can hear you  .  It was funny . ... That's the only part I'll miss , So   -- but ,   -- His position is pretty uh , ... stable . .. Yeah . .. Fletcher -- .. Well see , actually Fletcher was going to ask Hector to move back to editorial , but he didn't know how to approach him , cause he thought he was so thrilled about being associate producer . But Hector really hated it . So Hector's the one , .. when was it . .. Two weekend- -- ... Two weekends ago ? Or last weekend . He -- c- he said- -- He looked at me and he goes , .. pso . ... Lina , .. what happens on Hanukkah .  And I was going , ... I can't exactly remember the story , but , .. all I know is you light a candle , and open a present . .. And he goes , so , if I call Fletcher , it wouldn't be any great shakes , and I said , nope . .. I said what , h- he di- -- .. never told me why he was calling up Fletcher , so nan -- .. um , Sunday he looked at me and he goes , I'm calling Fletcher , I want to go back to editorial . .. I said okay , .. go ahead . .. So he called Fletcher , ... and Fletcher was so .. relieved . ... Cause he wanted to ask Hector to move back to editorial . .. He's just happy he did it . Why did he want to ask Hector to move back to editorial . Because he's so unhappy with the editorial staff . ... That they couldn't get what they wanted out of Sherry , and they couldn't get what it- .. they wanted out of Seppie . .. It's actually not Seppie's fault , it's kind of , they needed to work with him more , but that .. Sherry was impossible . .. She was a witch . ... And then her assistant .. pulled stunts where she didn't ... do stuff , that everybody knows assistants do . .. which I wouldn't know , but- cause I'm no assistant . But , things like , .. making sure that the script gets to the people doing the sound effects , so that they can follow along , and make certain that their sound effects are going in the right spots , that kind of thing ? She totally screwed up the- the show that they're working on now , .. I don't know what number that is . ... Sylvia . What show is being shown now . .. .. Well , it's the one they're working on , .. v- the one they're working on's not always the one that's being shown . No . But what .. one is tonight . .. Tonight ? .. I don't know . .. Four ? .. Five ?  .. Six ? This i- -- .. I don't know . ... We'll have to ch- -- Oh , this is the second one in the new season , Hm . but I don't know , if this was really number two , .. Hm . how they placed it , or if it was like , .. like you said , number three four or five . .. Because they had such a b- hard time with it . Like last week's wasn't supposed to be shown , even though it was supposed to be number one , because it was so poorly done . ... It had so much wrong with it . Hector kept trying to get it corrected , like a month ago ? ... And they kept stopping him , stopping , stopping , stopping , stopping . ... Cause of her . ... Cause of her , .. cause of Jake . ... Nixon . He didn't want him to do it . .. And it makes him look like an idiot , ... cause he's the director , and you can tell where he's missed the shots . Has nothing whatsoever to do with anybody else . .. It's Jake . ... But he'll s- -- He'd cut off his nose to spite his face . ... That's stupid . .. So now Fletcher's starting to realize what's going on . It's hard , .. because , .. the hatchet man actually in the group is Ed . .. Ed's the one that'll come in , ... and he'll go ahead and say , .. this is what needs to be done . ... Okay , and h- -- or he'll look at you , and he'll go , that was a stupid thing to do , why'd you do that . .. You know , makes the editor really stop and think . Or makes whoever it is stop and think , the director .  But , .. Fletcher'll kind of sit there and kind of go , well , mhm . Well , let me see , that -- that seemed to be okay , but I'll have to think about it . He's real wishywashy . .. He's too uh , .. namby pamby . ... You need somebody to come in and go , .. . .. . .. . ... Yeah .  tSo , .. they're kind of suffering that -- from that this year . .. Not having that on there . .. But , Fletcher's having to learn how to be more assertive . Otherwise his show's just gonna go down the tubes . Yeah .  And they can't afford that right now . .. How many countries is it in . Do you know ? .. Mm . .. All I know is , Cathy saw it in France . .. Oh really ? Yeah . .. I forgot what it's called . ... Something -- Huh . It's about -- has to do with the bar ... generation .  Um ,  The- .. bar gen -- generation . Yeah . Uh , What ? what is it . SIP The bar generation ? In what sense bar generation . Oh no , ... Pub . ... The Pub . ... The Pub Generation .  There you go . Pub None .   French .   So Cathy -- They watched it in French , g -- it was absolutely hilarious , Oh God .  .. I know cuz , I know , .. I thought that was really funny , None Dorks . .. The pub Generation . Wow . .. Have it in France . .. I know . That's good None . ... And they- -- they saw Mako . ... (GULP) Did I tell you , .. Harlan's wife ? ... Where . They had dinner with her one night .  .. Yeah ? And Cathy said , oh yeah , supposedly Alina's been on this diet and lost weight None .   She said , oh . .. You mean she's not so chubby ? ... Ooh , wait'll I see that bitch again . ... Was that nasty , or what . ... God , I said I wasn't gonna do this anymore . ... Stay up late . ... Kinda defeats the purpose of getting up in the morning . ... I know . .. And it's a hard habit to break . Usually I don't -- It is . s- Usually I don't stay up late . ... But it's like , if I'm up after midnight ?  .. It's just like  , ... Hm .  ... Yeah yeah . What can I do now .   . ... (GULP) I still can't -- (GULP) ... God I still can't believe Tim bitching around and , .. he lied too . ... He said that he talked to Ron , and all this other shit ? About what . ... About ... the way ... they were feeling , ... of them being the only ones cleaning the house , and all this other shit ? ... I mean what they don't realize , is like , ... shit , when Ron gets home from work , ... I wanna spend time with Ron , because Ron , ... usually doesn't get home till nine or ten . ... Yeah . Unlike Tim , he has to work , ... for every little dime that he makes . ... You know ? .. Yeah . He doesn't get any breaks . ... Yeah , ... Tim is on salary , and he can take leave , and , Mhm , ... and he earns leave , he's -- ... he gets sick leave , ... we don't get shit . ... I don't know . ... ... It is really hard living with another couple . ... I mean , .. we -- If we set our -- .. If we sit down and set some rules , which we never did , .. it could work . ... You know , .. Mhm . ... what it amounts to , is mutual r- respect , and l- like Tim told Ron , ... ... he told him , he goes um , ... what was it he goes , ... nobody fucks with my lifestyle . ... I feel the exact same way . ... And all those bitches and complaints that he has , they're about my lifestyle . ... Mhm , And he doesn't realize that . ... And that's what I'm gonna tell him . ... Well , .. nan you know , ... And the only way it's gonna work , is if we have respect for one another . That's right . ... That's right . And it doesn't mean , going to ... our parents , and ... complaining about one another , ... I'm gonna tell him , if you have any complaints , you .. talk to the person that you have the complaint about . ... I'm also going to suggest , ... weekly house meetings to discuss such things . .. Mhm . ... Oh yeah . ... Yeah . You know what it would be , a real good lesson for them , too , ... in self assertiveness , Yep . ... you know and , .. especially the way um , ... I mean Tim gets .. in- .. himself into a , uncomfortable situation or whatever , .. and his first reaction is to blow up about it . Mhm . ... You know , cause he let -- he lets it pile up . .. Yep . ... He doesn't do nothing ... positive about it , and then he just blows up . ... And if something bothers you , you go and you , ... I was , like last year , I was really proud of myself , when I was asked to take over .. intermediate .. algebra ? .. Unhunh . ... And teach it ? SIP SIP ... And I did . SIP ... And I also went , SIP ... and I asked for a raise , ... instead of None -- (GULP) .. cause instead of just sitting in the class and getting five dollars an hour , I was now gonna be up there teaching it , ... Mhm , .. and instead of getting the five dollars an hour , I ended up getting fifteen . ... Really . But I went and I asked . ... Now if i- -- You know if you ... put a situation like that to Tim or Mandy , ... cause not because they're ... they're weak in character or anything , but because they're -- ... They're babies . .. Yeah . ... They ... hem and haw around , and somebody else would have to talk for them . .. You know ? ... Yeah . ... ... I don't know . ... And it's , ... Right now uh , ... I don't know if I should mention it to him , or what , but , ... I'm feeling like he's taking me for granted . ... Yep . ... And he's rolling in it , Mary . ... And you know what the sad thing , ... the thing that really scares me ? ... is that they're n -- ... th- at the rate they're going , ... and with all the breaks that they've ... gotten , ... they're never gonna have hard times . ... Hard times do train you . ... Yep . ... They do . ... Like I came over here to work with Danae , which is what I'm going to do , ... I'm going to do some .. translations for her and stuff ? .. Yeah . ... tonight ? ... And um , SIP ... you know , ... I have to make at least fifty dollars or so , (GULP) to make it worth my time , ... but like tonight , ... well I called , ... you know , this thing was going on with Buck and everything , ... so I called um , ... Mandy's , ... or , .. I called our house , and Mandy answered the phone , and I said where's -- ... you know where's -- ... where -- Is Ron there ? And she said no . ..  When we were on our way to Tim's game , he was at Town Pump , and he asked what time .. we'd be home , and we said probably about nine . ... And she said then we went over to ... your grandma's , but  then we came back , and he wasn't here yet . ... So , ... I called the Town Pump , and asked if he was still in the casino , ... course he wasn't , ... he was on his way home . ... And I said tell -- .. So I called Mandy back , and I told her to , ... have him call me . ... when he got home . ... So , ... I was in the bathtub when he called , ... and I talked to him for a while and , ... he went and , ... he was really down about what ... what I told .. him that Tim had said to me , ... and how I was ... so upset ? ... He goes why didn't you tell him to go and wake me up . ... I said I did  , and he wouldn't do it . ... Really ? Mhm . ... He goes , they w- -- they were sitting around getting all ... fucked up , he said but , ... he said I went right to bed , he said I didn't get done working until after nine . ... Oh , man . ... Cause that five-car pile up they had between Hardin and Crow ? ... Oh , shit , really ? I didn't hear about it . ... Yeah . ... Ron was singlehandedly there . ...  .. with one wrecker . ... G- yeah . ... ... Seems like any time I've seen a wrecker out here , there's always two guys in there . Hm-m  , everyone was gone , when the call came in . ... Oh . And Jay's not supposed to go on those anymore , because of his heart , ... so he had to send Ron by himself , and Ron was slowly pulling everybody out of the ditch . ... Did they all hit each other ? Or just , .. Kind of . .. A a semi ... bumped a car , and then went and , ... went on two wheels , and , ... just about lost it , and then ... got back up on all ... all its wheels again . ... Oh . ... Did it land in the ditch ? But it  -- ... Kind of , it was able to get out , but all the other cars that were ... in the .. direct ... vicinity , all hit the ditch . ... And then , ... there was three cars .. and the semi . ... And then , ... this uh , ... this guy ... pulled up and , SIP .. he was going to uh , ...  Peggy , ... you remember Peggy White ? ... Yeah . Her husband , Gary Bighare ? Mhm ? ... Him and her pulled up , and they were in the van ? ... And they stopped to ask Ron what happened ? ... And here another car came and rear-ended em . ... Oh . And they ended up having to take um ... Peggy White ... by helicopter to Billings . ... Man that's pretty bad . ... I know . ... Darn , ... this darn dog keeps ... breathing , and like ... dreaming , you know I wonder if we should wake her up ? ... No , .. she'll get scared and want to go outside . ... Kinda nervous , you know . ... They say you can really ... mess up a dog , by waking em up when they're dreaming . .. Really ? ... Mhm . ... It's so cold outside , but yet sometimes she insists on staying out there . I know . ... You know what I was thinking of doing ? Hunh . ... I don't know , she's kind of shy , but I was wondering , (SNEEZE) ... what it would be like to ... train her , (SNIFF) ... to pull a sled . ... I don't know if she'd do it . ... I don't know if she would either . ... She's kind of timid . .. Mhm . ... She doesn't trust too many people at all . ... Yeah . ... ... Oh and you know another thing that Tim had the audacity to bitch about ? .. What . ... He said um , ... Mandy had to stay up all by herself and decorate the tree . ... until four in the morning . ... And I even asked if we could put our ornaments on there , and they told me that .. there wouldn't be enough room . ... Really ? Mhm , .. Tim said that . ... She was probably lonely when she was doing it , you know that ? ... She probably was . ...  -- I sat up with her , and I was talking to her , she was doing all the decorating , .. I mean ,  ... what was I gonna do . She- I mean , she was just .. putting up the balls and everything and , ... she'd say where , ... where do you think this should go and , ... so I was sitting there doing my Welfare application . ... And uh , ... you know I was just sitting there watching her , telling her ... where to put everything and what not . ... Did you know Nickie wanted her own tree ? ... Yes ? ... And I forgot to bring it in , it's outside ? ... What are you gonna do with it . ... She wants to set it up for her Barbies . ... I was just gonna use a tin can and put rocks in the bottom ? .. Mhm . .. And just stick it in there . ... And you know what I did ? Hm . I didn't want to waste a tree's life ,  ... so I just cut a branch off one  . ... ... God , I fell up there . ... SIP Where'd you go . ... to get em . ... You know where Sarah and Arvela live ? .. Mhm , .. Just around the corner . ... Remember that first .. cattle guard you go over ? ... Unhunh , I didn't even go over that . ... You mean , ... kinda like .. by the -- ... by the tunnel ? Right below the tunnel . ... Oh . ... And I just walked up -- ... We just walked up around uh , that area , God Alice that was fun . Did you get grandma a tree too ? Hunhunh . ... Does she already have one ? ... Hmm . ... That pickup could only hold like three . ... Mm . ... I wonder why -- .. Did daddy say to take the pickup back ? Or what was the deal . Yeah . .. Yeah . Why . ... Cause Phoebe needs it . ... What's wrong with the car . ... Oh , you didn't hear about it ? Hunhunh . ... Oh , you did , about how the .. engine was on fire ? .. Mhm , ... See there was oil spilling out , ... leaking out from ... the valve cover . ... Mhm . The valve cover gasket apparently cracked or whatever , and there was oil coming out , .. and the oil got hot , and you know how it gets hot and okes ? Mhm . ... Well , I guess enough came out , ... because we were losing oil bad , ... going from Billings to .. Crow , um , ... there's a lot of nan SIP nan oke coming out , and by the time we got to Hardin , we had to put like uh , ... three or four quarts in . ... Unhunh . ... It was three . ..  .. And , .. by the time we got to nan ... nan Crow , ... it was , ... it was one quart low . ... And there was oke still coming from under the engine , I figure w- if it was losing that much oil , then it caught fire . Mhm . Cause the engine was hot , cause there wasn't .. enough water in the ... radiator . ... Mhm . I talked to Oscar about it , and he said , well I checked , it was only , .. it was only about , I'd say a half a quart to a quart short of water . ... But that shouldn't make any difference . He goes the only thing I can think of , is that there was an air lock in there .  ... And that running the engine out on the open road ? .. Mhm . Caused that air lock to come through . ... flushed it out . And bust the ... gasket ? ... No , ... it would more or less um , ... the engine wasn't being kept cool enough . ... Cause there wasn't enough fluid .. in the radiator . SIP Unhunh , ... And , you know how the radiator's , the pipe's close to other parts of the engine ? Yeah . ... So what nan It was some part in there . nan caused the fire . ... The engine being too hot , .. and the oil leaking , ... So he knew that the oil was leaking ? No , ... we knew we were losing oil , but we didn't know where . I just figured it was from that valve cover gasket . ... Just from lifting up the hood and looking at it . ... So what's he gonna do . ... Well , .. and two of his wires , the sparkplug wires ? ... Unhunh . were fried all the way through . ... Unhunh . .. So we took those off and we , .. replaced them with some old ones out of the garage . .. I knew that . And it runs . ... It runs . There's enough uh , ... radiator fluid in there . ... Mhm . ... so that it will , ... It's .. it's enough . ... Mhm . ... SIP But I think running it out on the open road , will cause it ... possibly to shoot more oil out . ... Mhm . That valve cover gasket has to be replaced . ... Hm . ... ... I don't know . Oh I freaked Cookie and , ... Rita and , ... Gary out tonight . ... Remember the Plain- .. Plainfeather uh .. Claypit ? ... where that red clay is ? ... Mhm . ... Right there . ... I saw my .. my speedometer just go Brr . .. like that just down . You know , and I knew exactly what it was . ... What I have to do , is take off the distributor wire , and splice it in with the fuel pump wire . ... Mhm . Because my .. fuel pump is now electric , .. Never used to be . ... Mhm . ... Hand me that ashtray . ... Or your light , I mean . .. Your light . ... It's behind the sewing machine . And uh , ... sometimes it gets loose . ... And .. no more fuel . Unhunh , So I stopped the car , and they said what are you doing . I said , oh , I gotta tighten this wire here . ... ... So I had Cookie .. turn on the ignition and turn it off . ... So , .. cause see , once you turn that key on , ... then you hear the , .. the fuel pump .. come on . ... Mhm . ... And if the wire's not connected right , .. it doesn't come on . ... Mhm . ... So I did that , ... and I lit a match to find out where I was , and , ... n- after everything was hunkydory , .. then I , ... shut the hood , and got back in , and I started up the engine and , both Gary and Rita were sitting on the edges of their seat . ... And I turned around and I looked , .. and I said , ... did I scare you kids ? ... They wouldn't say anything , then Gary goes , .. .. yeah , I was scared .  ... ... But I freaked em out , ... I don't know . ... Then daddy said something about the steering column on my car needing work ? .. Mhm , ... Said long as I don't drive it fast , it should be alright . ... But oh man I don't know . ... See the thing about it is , ... if I go after Ken , I'm not really gonna have any money . ... Mhm , ... to um , ... you know , do things . ... I'm not saying I'm gonna ... pay for everything , but , ... I don't want to be broke around him . ... I know , that really sucks . ... Cause I wanna at least be able to put ... gas in the car , (GULP) ... Mhm . and go do something . ... I don't think it's such a good idea for you to go up there in the winter . ... Mm . ... I've been thinking about that . ... We should all get some money together and , ... is there any way he could like ,  meet us in Great Falls or something ? ... Cause I'd like to go up there and go to the , .. um , ... Red Lobster ? ... Really ? ... Yeah . ... Cause I've been just , ... craving seafood . That's the half point , he could do it . ... Yeah . I bet he could do it . ... When though . ... I don't know , ... He goes back to school like the second . None ... Oh , shoot . ... Well isn't there any way , like we -- .. that we could just meet him up there and , ... maybe -- What , bring him down ? ... Bring him down , or , ... I don't wanna take your car . ... SIP ... I was gonna ask you and mom , too , if you could um , ... take care of Trace for a couple days next week . ... Oh ? ... What you got in mind . ... I need to get caught up on my work . ... SIP Wednesday I have an appointment at nine thirty . ... Mom's off , isn't she ? ... Oh , that's right . ... That's right . ... Yeah I think that'd , ... I think that'd um , ... work out , ... like if she had to go shopping or something maybe you could go with her , and help her with him ? ... And Nicky helps her .. with him a lot anyway . ... And then of course he adores me .  ... Mhm . ... I remember I was pregnant with Nicky . ... And uh , Boots's little boy , ... he really liked me . Mhm . ... when I was pregnant with her ? Mhm . ... You know how it is when we're pregnant , we ... get real sleepy ? Mhm . ... I'd fall asleep on the couch , and he'd lay by me . ... Mhm . .. And he'd fall asleep with me . ... And I remember he would -- ... I woke up , and here he was gone , his mother carried him in the other room , .. Mhm . ... and God , that kind of pissed me off . ... Was -- Would um , ... Was Nicky mad when Trace was a boy ? ... Kind of . ...  She thinks I should have twins . ... Twin girls . ... COUGH ... But I don't think she'll realize the uh , ... sibling rivalry . ... But I don't know , .. she's six years old now . ... And they say that if there's six years between children , there's not that much rivalry . ... After four there's almost none . ... Really ? .. Mhm . ... Cause they're , Four is ideal . ... they're kind of in different worlds , ... Yeah . ... Because , ... see , Trace will be , ... the next time I have a baby , ... Trace will probably be , ... about three ? .. four ? ... Hm . ... That's when I'm gonna get this shit taken out . ... Tammy Kashen has one of these too . ... What is it . ... Norplant ? ... Oh really . ... Deon told me . ... Cause I asked him what ... his intentions were with her . ... Cause I told him I thought he was too young to be ... so involved . ...  ... Gwen was telling me that , ... Did she talk to you lately ? Hmm . ... They had a cyst on her ovary . ... And they had to go in and take it out ? ... Mhm . ... Take out that cyst ? Mhm .  ... And it's really screwed up her uh , ... menstrual p- -- cycle ? her cycle , her , ... her ... hormones ? Unhunh . And they said that she might have to get pregnant again , just to straighten it out . ...  ...  ... So , .. and then she goes , ... so tell -- tell Deon . And she really laughed . ... I don't know if Tammy would be too happy with that though . ... Seems to me that she's trying to straighten herself out , and , ... pursue a family . ... Tammy ? ... What do you think . ... I don't know . ... Or do you think it might be a matter of convenience . ... I think it's a convenience for both of em . ... Yeah ? ... Yeah ? ... It's also a convenience for Cookie . ... Oh yeah . . TALK FOOTSTEPS Okay . ... Um , The -- ... The way that your testimony is FOOTSTEPS coming in , ... I don't know if I explained this to you on the phone , Hmm . is ,  when a person is charged with multiple crimes ,  .. and , um , .. there .. are other incidences , where he acted in the same way ? Mhm ,  When we have to prove , in this case we have to prove specific intent . TALK ... to expose himself to a person , .. for sexual arousal . Mm . Um , .. when we have to prove something like specific intent , um , or we have to prove identity . ... Because he's disputing identity in a coup- -- in ... at least one of the cases . Hm .  Um  , then , we are allowed to bring in , ... prior similar conduct . ... Um , .. where he acted in .. a , .. an identical way , or where the victims were in a similar situation . Okay . Things like that , That's why we're able to have you come in and testify . Okay . Okay , .. Um , ... the cases that we have , ... already , .. are , um , .. one happened back in October of nineteen ninety , . Alright . and it happened on BART , .. and it's almost a carbon copy of your case . Well I've made two , ... one a year from , ... almost a year from the , .. uh police report . I saw that in your report . I haven't seen the other report . Yeah , I made that one through , matter of fact it was just .. over the phone , and they never called me back or anything , and a year later it happened again , Okay .  and , then that's when they made the report , and said they were gonna do something about it . .. Okay . .. So it happened around -- So you can testify to two of em . None -- Yeah . That's why I had you come up , because , Yeah , ... um , ... that's great . Yeah . Um , I mean not for you ,     but ,  Mhm . for us ,  Um , .. ... i- -- in our first case , .. Amelia Gonzalez , .. um , ... that uh , that happened back in ninety . And she was seated a in the rear of the train , Yeah , which .. you were , Mhm .  um , ... nobody else was around , ... and he sort of walked up and down the train . Down the aisle , .. Mhm . checked everything out , Yeah , ... and then sat down , Mhm , .. put the newspaper on his lap , Yeah , masturbated , and then lifted the paper up , Yeah , .. for her to see . ... And she saw it , .. in the .. the reflection , n- n- -- Oh , the mirror .  cause she was looking out the window , That's how I did it too . saying I don't want to see this . Cause I didn't want to see him , so I looked this way , and you can see it . ... Right . You know , Cause it turns into the mirror effect . Yeah , mhm ,  And he was just sort of staring at her , .. and lifting up the paper . Yeah , mhm .  Um , ... so , .. anyway , Exactly .  it c -- it's a carbon copy , Yeah . .. and , .. um , in that case he's , .. nan he sits through all the testimony , and he just sort of shakes his head , and makes these big gasps , like , you know , we're creating this whole thing against him . Hm . Um ,  and then with June ,  .. um , the woman that just walked out , Unhunh , um , ... she was riding on BART , .. and , ... he came and sat near her , ... she moved , ... he moved to get closer to her , .. she moved again , .. and he moved directly opposite her , Mhm . and then started masturbating . Yeah . .. So , ... well see , .. what it is , it seems like he wants someone more scary , ... y I don't know , cause ,  ... he would walk up and down the aisles , there was women on the other side , too , but they'd look like , you know , you wouldn't mess with em , but if you're sitting there , you know , trying to mind your own business , or , Right . .. look like you can intimidate someone , you know , Right . I i- --  that's what it look like , .. I think that's , I think he he finds somebody that's isolated , Mhm .  and he .. goes for a certain age group , I think . Yeah . .. Um , .. and , you know like nan , for some reason I think he likes students , or people who look like students . Unhunh . Mhm . .. So , ..  anyway , .. okay , .. um , .. did you , ... as far as your , ... um , ... mileage STAPLE goes . ... What would did -- Oh how much was it , Hundred and thirty , s- I don't know . ... Okay . ... And we got the um , ... that ticket  for our  ? .. Parking ? Yeah . Okay . ... They moved the gate or something ? ... The , how to get in the parking lot , ... cause it used to be on ,  Oh yeah . Yeah . Because they built .. this building . Oh . See  , That's where the , yeah . we had to get back all the way on the freeway ,   Oh no . and I was like , None oh God , .. there was a door here before , a entrance , you know , Yeah .  I couldn't find it ,  but uh , we found it . .. Um , ... oh okay . Do you know how much it's gonna be ? ... Oh no , not yet . Okay . Um , .. do you guys have the cash to pay for it right now ? ... When you- to get out ? .. Yeah I think so , Yeah . Yeah . Okay . Then what I'll do .. is , ... when -- .. you can -- .. I'll call you and find out . Okay . .. What I have to do is , submit all of this to our accounting department , Okay . and they give you ... the , .. they'll mail you the .. reimbursement . Okay . So you guys hang on to that , Okay . so you can get out . Okay . Alright . And then , ... I imagine it will be about .. five dollars or so . Okay .  Um , .. so . PAPERS ... a hundred and thirty , .. about a hundred and thirty five you think ? Yeah . Mhm , Okay . ... So round trip it'll be like .. two seventy . two si- -- Yeah . ... PAPERS WRITING ... ...

Let's just go through , .. um , I I have your statement , but I just want to .. have you tell me , Okay . what happened . Alright . ... Um , (SNIFF) ... do you remember the date ? ... No . ... Okay . .. Because I'll be , ...  saying to you , ... do you recall , on August twelfth , .. nineteen ninety two . Okay . Okay , and it was about one o'clock ? Mhm . Okay . ... So , ... first of all , where did you get on BART . .. At Oakland . .. Okay . And where were you going . ... Um , .. to the doctor's , .. in San Francisco . ... San Francisco . .. And , um , ... when you got on BART , .. I'll ask you to ... describe where you sat , ... on the train , Okay . and let me show you , .. um , .. what I have , ... This is a .. diagram .. of ... the interior of BART . Mhm . ... Okay looking at that , these are the backs of the seats , Yeah . So facing that way , okay  , Okay . Um , ... can you -- ... Um , ... that's the .. train . Right ? Right . u That seat right there , I always sit going backwards . .. I have None -- Okay so the train was traveling that way , Yeah unhunh . Okay . ... So , ... um , And it's hard to describe how , so  ,  yeah . I was sitting backwards in the back seat . .. Okay .  The very end seat . And , .. when he came in , .. when .. where was he when you first saw him .. come in . None He got on the train on like , I think Twelfth Street or something ? in .. Oakland ? And like in a , ... let me see . ... Okay . ... He got on another car . ... But you can -- I .. I seen him , because I seen him a year ago . Unhunh . So I seen him when the , ... you know how the train goes , and you can see everybody out the window , well he got in another .. door . Okay . And he came through here . Okay . .. Alright . .. So he came through here , Mhm . when he came through here , .. did he look at you at all ? Mhm . Initially ? Yeah . What did he do . Just looked , he had a -- Did he stop walking ? n , just kinda looked , .. and then looked , and then .. walked . .. Okay . And then he kept walking . Yeah .  When he looked at you the first time , was he sort of , ... looking you up and down , or , .. did he just look at your seat , .. wh -- Just like , .. you know , look . uh I guess ,  -- At you ? At me . Di- -- Okay . Yeah , and look at my seat , .. cause , I always sit ... all the way to the window . Okay . So I thought he was gonna sit down . .. Actually . .. Okay . None Hunh None .  And then he continued on , Unhunh . and where did he go . He went all the way to the , .. you know , into the .. train , All the way up here ? Mhm . Okay . And then , uh he went through the door , and then he came back . ... again . .. Okay . He went through there , He went through these doors ? into it unhunh , into another car . Oh .  And then he came back again , .. and then , I guess that was like another stop , and more people were getting off , .. and then , ... that's when he came .. and sat by me , sat .. in this seat right here . But , .. there was someone sitting there too . there was a lady , You're kidding . Unhunh , there was a lady sitting there , but she got up , .. and she went to another seat . ... Ah . She , she just went to a different seat . ... Okay . You know like , but he was making nan , I don't know how you describe it , you know how you can be like a nuisance to someone ? Mhm . Or .. you may ell or something , Yeah . you know like that you know , Yeah . or moving around , you know like , ... as he wanted her to move . .. Okay .  And she got up and moved . S- she , okay . ... Um , ... and , so when she moved , .. was there anybody seated ,  in this area . ... I think maybe like , you know how these chairs are ? Unhunh . Maybe right here , and , .. you know , Okay . but you couldn't they couldn't see nothing , or anybody , Okay , but nobody right , No ,  in these areas . I don't believe so . Okay . .. Alright . ... So then , .. what did he do . ... Um , ... did the newspaper  . you know , .. looking at it , you know , .. making loud noises , I guess so I think like that or whatever ,  ... then , .. he just kept doing that to the newspaper like that , and then , he went in , ... and then he just , you can just see him going like this , you know how you have to .. unzip your pants ? Yeah . or something , like that , ... and I'm looking through the window . ... and then he's still making noises with the paper , ... and then um , ... I kinda looked , and then I didn't and I .. kept making like , ... s uh .. you know like None , you know like None I know what you're None -- He was making noises like that ?  No , he was making those , .. you know , the rattling paper , Unhunh . but I was making noises like , None you know like , I wanted him to know , I know what you're doing . Yeah . You know I remembered him for a year -- .. from a year ago . And so , then I just kept , you know I just turned , you know , away from him , and I looked in the window , and .. he just kept B hitting the paper nan . ... like that , .. nan B you know ? But you know what he was doing . Yeah .  He kept hitting the paper , ... and um , ... uh , let me see , then one time I just , you know , kinda .. looked over , and then you can see it . .. You know , ... you can see it . ... Had he lifted up the paper in any way , or , ... Yeah , just like , ... CLAP you know , I'm trying to see how a paper goes , likes thi , Like this . .. Okay , ... nan , ... like , he has the paper like , .. like this , .. just like , .. you know , moves it . Like that . ... You know , like that . Oh , You know and you can see it . Okay . You know ? Was he looking at you at all during that time . Yes . The whole .. entire .. time . Okay . I mean , not looking , at PAPER first he would go like this , even , .. with the paper . ... And look at me . ... You know , trying to get my attention PAPER . Yeah . Like he wanted me to look at him . And , .. then the whole time under here , he'd just look . ... I mean , .. nan he looked so hard , that it was like burning ,  you know what I mean ? Yeah . It- --  Tell the jury that . Okay  . That's -- .. I mean that's great . He just , .. alright . None -- Um , Because that's what he does . Okay . And that's his way ,  of drawing your attention to him , Mhm . because , ... if somebody's doing that to you , .. there's no way you're gonna , ... you know , .. just totally ignore them , Yeah . cause you're always going to wanna keep them in your peripheral vision , (SNIFF) at least . Yeah . Mhm . to make sure .. where they are . Mhm . Yeah . Cause I was , you know , I didn't know what he was gonna do , Yeah , or anything , so  , so , um , part of our burden is to prove , that he's deliberately doing th , that he has the specific intent to draw your attention to him . Okay . .. So let them know that he was doing that . Okay . .. Alright . ... Um , .. okay . So then , ... and then , .. he sort of pulled the paper aside , and he's still staring at you , Yeah . Unhunh still staring and , ... just , you know , .. and then , .. but when uh uh , ... like you come to a stop , see that's all through the tunnel . ... You know , that's a long , .. like about , Mhm . .. five minute ride or something ? A couple of minutes ride , and we got to like Embarcadero , PAPER he would just , you know , go like this , you know PAPER , before anyone got on , and wait , and then just do the same thing , until I had to get off at my stop . .. Tell .. the jury about that too , because that indicates that he knew what he was doing was wrong , Hm . Oh okay . and if there was a chance that any man .. might walk by , y -- Mhm . You know , I had another case , or , .. I have a .. pr- report from another case where ,  um , ... he wa- -- he was crouched down , and doing it , Mhm . and then when .. a man would walk by , he'd sit up , Yeah .  And , .. you know , do nothing , and then once the man was through the doors , then he'd go back   doing it . Yeah . .. Okay . .. So . ...  Um , .. okay so then you got off ,   ... at your stop . Yeah . Um , and .. how were you feeling . ... Well , it was like , ... s I don't know , ... sorry , None ... You doing alright , .. just , I don't know , like disgusted , ... you know , wh , .. why I really wanted to report it this time because , it was like summertime ? None Unhunh , and the kids ? ... You know the kids and everything , Yeah . that's what I was scared of , because I know how , uh I was , you know , a victim of , ... you know , abuse like that or  , I just , you know , I just , ... That's what I was think , the very first time I reported , it was just like this .. dirty old man , just that that , Yeah . None And this time , it was during the summer and there was lots of kids , and um , .. I just felt like , .. you know , upset . You know , Yeah . .. and I just , you know , .. .. I just felt upset . .. Okay . You know , .. n- None -- Tell the jury that . ... Um , it's .. it's really important that they understand , (SNIFF) .. the feelings that go through you when sombody does something like that to you , None cause , (SNIFF)  my one concern about this case .. is , um , ... that .. some people may have the attitude of , (SNIFF) well , .. he never touched you , Mhm . .. he didn't .. make any verbal threats to you , it's no big deal . (SNIFF) ... And , especially , .. I have some .. young single men , .. on my jury panel . Mhm ,  And , ... I -- .. my .. worry is that they don't .. relate to what a woman feels , .. when something like that is happening , Mhm . because their experience would be totally different . if a man exposes himself , (SNIFF) which , .. a man would never do that . Mhm . Because , (SNIFF)  number one they pick out , .. I think .. more vulnerable people . Mhm .  But if , .. um , ... a man .. were to be exposed to , they would ... laugh , .. or , .. you know , be disgusted , Mhm .  or be mad , but they wouldn't necessarily feel , (SNIFF) ((KNOCK_KNOCK_KNOCK) .. scared .. or threatened , ((DOOR_OPENS) Unhunh , .. Hi , Hi . Can I sit with you ? Sure . ...: Um , so r- ... relate that information to the jury . ((DOOR_CLOSES) Okay . Okay . ... Um , ... .. and then , .. uh , so then when you got off , you called .. the police . No . Right ? I went upstairs to the BART , and told them , and I tried to tell them what train it was ,  and I just , ... I was still kind of like shocked , so I I was like , well I have to go , cause I have to make an appointment , but I did tell someone , I said I'll be back to make a report or whatever I had to do ,  and then there was a different person down there , and , .. when I called the BART police , they said oh no one's even said anything to us , you know and uh , Yeah . That was that , and then I think , uh , .. couple of days after , .. one of the uh , .. detectives , called me and then I made a report . He wanted to see if I can ID him first , and then , .. we just made a report and he said , .. he'll submit it and everything . Okay . .. and you ID'ed him immediately . (SNIFF) Unhunh , he just showed me . He's all okay , come with me , come with me , you know , Okay . ... Alright . I have nan , .. a- and this is , i- if they make an issue out of it , this is what you looked at . Right ? Mhm , Like a folder with different , Yeah , yeah , right there . And I have the one where you signed right underneath it . Unhunh , .. yeah , And , ... we've got the statement where you immediately said I'm hundred percent sure this is the guy . Mhm . Yeah . So . ... Okay . .. What is he a old man ? .. He's like .. sixties . In his -- .. Yeah . Yeah . God . .. And he's like balding like , Yeah . You can come in the courtroom . Oh good . Okay . Yeah . .. Um , she has anxiety attacks when she gets excited and , See that's why I'm s- -- she gets real nervous and scared , That's why I am tra , Unhunh . she has bad anxiety attacks . .. I can't breathe . She she'll ju- -- Oh really ? That's why I'm trying to , Yeah sh , That's why she's crying , Okay . so , .. Okay . Um , .. m- how -- .. Do I have to look at anyone , just you , or , No , you can just look at me , Okay , ... um , .. when you go in , let me explain to you what the courtroom's like so you know what to expect . Okay , ... Um , ... you .. you don't have to , ... you know , and if you , .. if you feel like you need to take a break , Mhm , .. then .. tell me .. immediately . Okay . ... Um , .. or ask the judge , you'll be seated right near the judge . Okay . Um , .. I was saying to June , .. that , you know , a lot of times people are intimidated by the courtroom , and they think it's really formal , and it's really not that formal , Mhm . Okay . um , the jurors that are in there , .. there'll be twelve people seated in the juror box , .. Mhm ,  and um , (SNIFF) ... you know they could be your family . .. They could be your friends . Mhm ,  Um , they're all , nan y- y- from all walks of life , Mhm . um , they're all different ages , and , .. um , they , ... .. you know , for the most part , they were probably very nervous when they came in just for jury duty . Yeah . So , (SNIFF) um , .. they just want to hear your story , and they're not .. judging you . Okay . .. Um , PAPER .. let me .. show you , ...    baby , .. Hm ? ... Hmm . .. Mhm . Will it help to have him in there ? .. Yes unhunh  , Good ... PAPER . ... She was going crazy all day here , I think that's him . Every time every time she seen a  , The whole time down here , I was like that ain't him  . I was doing that . That's him , that's him , like that , he was like , oh no , no it's not him . Just come on None .  ... ... I don't know where I drew it out . .. (THROAT) (SNIFF) ... So is he in like jail or something ? Or he just shows up for court ?  No he's out right now , .. Oh okay . he will be , .. Oh okay . at the end of this , if the jury does the right thing . Alright . Um , ... we .. asked for ninety days county jail before the case , ... went .. to trial , Mhm . and normally , .. um , .. it'll be higher . ... if he's convicted . .. Okay . So , plus he's got your case pending .. in .. Oakland , Oakland . and if there's a , if we get a conviction just on one case here , Mhm ,  then , your case in Oakland will be a felony . .. Oh , okay . ... So , Alright . ...  um , okay . Yu -- ... W- what will happen is , ... you'll walk into the courtroom here . .. Mhm . There are doors right here . Yeah .  There are seats right here , .. um , .. that are for the audience , but normally there's nobody in the audience but , Okay . your husband will be there ,  um , .. and , .. then , ... there are two tables right here . .. I'll be seated at this table . Mhm .  And , .. the defendant .. and the defense attorney will be seated at this table . Mhm .  The .. jury ... sits here . .. Okay ? all in a row , um , (SNIFF) then , .. and you'll walk thr- -- When you walk in you'll walk through and I'll walk with you , .. Okay .  um .. to .. the ch- the witness chair , .. okay , Okay . which faces out this way . .. Alright . And the judge is seated right here . (SNIFF) Alright . Right above you . And then there's a woman who sits here who's the clerk , and there's a woman who sits here the- who's the court reporter . Okay . And so when I ask you questions , (SNIFF) when you're talking you need to , .. uh , .. always say yes or no , .. as opposed to unhunh or unh- None , Oh okay .  or nodding your head , .. okay , because she takes everything down . Okay . .. Um , if your nervous , ... please tell me . Okay . Or tell the judge and we can take a break . Okay . If you want to get a drink of water , or something like that . Okay . Okay ? ... Um , .. and , ... take your time , you know , when you .. walk in just take a deep breath , .. Okay . take your time . .. If I ask you a question that you don't understand , tell me , Okay .  Um , .. if .. we- either of us ask you a question where , (SNIFF) Um , it's something you don't remember ? .. it's a detail that you don't remember , Mhm . it's fine to say I don't , I don't remember at this time . Okay . ... Okay ?  ... Um  , Is there gonna b- -- .. the other .. person ? .. his lawyer gonna ask some questions ? Yeah , None Cross examine None . he'll be able to ask you questions also . He's , ... he's a very polite guy . Okay . He's a young .. attorney , um , he's with the public defender's office , ... he's , ... um , .. w when we had the case the last time , ... it was a different attorney . Mhm . And that attorney ... terrorized my , ... my one victim that I put on , um , .. he ... walked up to her , and he was about this .. far away from her , Mhm . and , sh- -- cause she had testified , .. when he walked in initially and he looked at me , ... Walter Munson , .. she said , I ... I .. knew he was a pervert , .. just by the way he looked at me . Oh .  So this man walked up to him and he said , I'm standing close to you , I'm looking at you , does that make me a pervert ? Mhm . And , .. uh , .. just badgered her , Aw . but this .. this attorney is not like that at all . (SNIFF) None Okay None . He'll be very polite ,  um , None Mhm None , ... he's going to try and focus more on , ... uh , .. discrepancies , like if you testify to one thing , and there's something written differently in the report . Unhunh . He might say well , .. you know , ... in your , (SNIFF) in the report it says that you , .. um , ... you know , .. he sat down , ... right across from you , Mhm . immediately . Oh okay . as opposed to walking , or something like that . Okay . which it doesn't but , Okay .  um , he's gonna try and focus on little things , cause that's all he can do . Okay .  But , (SNIFF) for the most part he'll be .. polite .. and gentle . Okay . .. So you don't have to worry about him . .. Hm . Um , ... ... what hap- -- well tell me about the ... year ago incident . .. Um , .. that one was at night time . ... And , um , I was working late , and it was around , .. I remember I used to get off ar- around nine , and I used to get to um , .. the Bart station around ten o'clock ? ... And , ... he would be nan , .. I think , .. I'm trying to think , would he get on , or would he already be on . Well that's the Daly City one , so he would .. get on , .. when I would get on , but I think .. probably like a different car , and , .. same thing , .. exact , identical . Go up and down the aisles , but , I would be the only one in the train . .. You know , because at night time there's not many people on there , and , .. he would do that , and I was , ... I was terrified then , because I was the only one , there was no one around . Yeah . I , .. you know , I was a little scared this time but , .. you know , but there's people around , like , .. you know , I don't think he would do anything , ... when people are around . Right . You know , down at the other seats or in back , Right . I could scream but , .. Yeah . .. at night time he was doing the same thing , and I called that night , ... to .. the Bart police , and I told them what he looked like , and everything , and , I never heard anything again . .. So , Okay . um , (SNIFF) .. Did he use a newspaper that time also ? Mhm . So identical , Everything . Yeah . Okay . And then I even told them , I said , ... and the funny thing is , he just -- .. the only thing he changed this time , is um , he wore a new bow tie , and uh a different bag , .. cause he always had a bag , .. cause the , .. what made the  interested in this case , they s- told me , well , .. everyone's telling me he has this bag , he carries around , and he has a bowtie , like that , and I go , Yeah . .. that's the only difference , he had a different bag this time a year later , and a different bow tie . Yeah .  And they were like okay , you know , Now the bag that he was carrying around this time , what was it . ... M , .. let me see , I think , ... a duffel bag ? .. I think , Okay . Okay . One time it was a duffel bag , and then one time it was like a , ... uh , what do you call them .  .. Like a sh , .. like a .. old be , Shopping bag ? Yeah . a shopping bag . a plastic , Yeah . Yeah , Mhm . .. That's his common one , .. plastic bag filled with papers . Okay . Yeah . ... Yeah , in this one you say he's carrying a sho- a duffel bag , A duffel bag okay .  Okay , so you wanna , Have you read through your statement recently ? No . Do you wanna read through it ? Yeah . Okay . Okay , ... (STRETCH)  None hm None , ... nan   (SNIFF) ... Now you can't do anything to this guy . ..   Oh I'm not , I'm just gonna sit back and look .  .. Mhm , I'm a little worried about her , cause she has them anxiety attacks .  .. She just don't have no control over her body . ... Train None , When will the ... verdict be . ... Um , .. well , it depends . .. Uh .. you two are my last witnesses , .. and then the defendant will testify . (SNIFF) .. And then , we could do closing arguments today , or it could be tomorrow . ... And then , ... w- we should have a verdict by Friday afternoon . .. Okay . No later than Friday afternoon . .. So I'll call all of you and tell you . ..  Is he gonna take the stand ? He says so . ... Mhm . H- What could he possibly ... say None ?  He testified in a trial , ... um , ... about five years ago . Sa- identical ... situation , Really ,  and he said , .. his testimony was , my momma didn't raise me to do things like this . ... He totally denied it . Mhm . ... So . So , .. cause I was just telling him , the same thing happened to my mom . .. Oh really ? Yeah . She was -- Was it him ? .. I don't know . She just told me that , you know , it was a long time ago , .. you're saying five years ago , Yeah . it was around that time , and she told me , but he used to , ... I don't know , she she didn't say anything newspaper whatever , but , he would , ... do .. finish the job . Oh . Everything , you know , and , Oh . so , but , she said she reported it , and no one ever did anything . They're hard cases , .. um , .. to act on , Mhm . and I think the reason why they finally .. started .. acting on these , and .. getting .. the identification , Mhm . was because so many of em were coming in . Oh , okay . .. ... Do you have any questions June ? ... ... No . .. Okay . ... Um , ... I'm going to put June on first , ... Okay . .. and then , ...  then Rickie . ... And then will you let us know what the final verdict is ? Yes . ... Hm None . Definitely . ... Hopefully it's good news . ... ... If it's not , .. I'll be bummed .    Cause I've been living with this case now for so long , .. . ... Am I doing that right so far ? ... Mhm . ... All the way down to that ? ... Mhm . ... I think . ... I don't think I am . Do you ? ... And you'd have to have that plus or minus .  What . I don't know what I did to get that . .. Where did I get that .. square root of- -- um , ... ex squared . Because you brought this .. over here . ... You brought ... three over here . ... divided by three , and then you have ex squared , so if you want to find ex , you have the square root of ex squared . ... I guess all I can't figure out is , what the square root of negative two thir- .. thi- .. two thirds is . ... Would that be , ... i square root two , i square root two thirds ? ... o- over three , ... The whole thing would be over three . Well . No it couldn't be . ... Square root of two thirds , yeah . ...   But then you got the other one Nathan . Oh , gosh , ... hm . ... Leah . ... She snoozing on the floor ? .. Mhm . ... Not anymore , you woke her up . ...  ...  ...  ... ... She's doing the karate kid , Nathan . .. She's like , leave me alone . ... Do I deserve this  .        I mean how would you like it , when you're laying in bed ,    somebody just grabbed your arm , started swinging it around . ... I'd probably just slap em . ... Ex squared equals one over the square root of that , .. the square root of that , ... ex equals the square root of one None , She's not even looking at me . She's just looking , like -- .. I know . .. That's what I'm talking about . ... ... So . ... would that one be , ... square root of one half ? ... Mhm , ... It would ? ... Mhm . ... Yep . ... But do y'all have to do that , .. um , ... you have to like , ... have it where you do that , .. there's no , ... um , ... fraction under the- -- under the , ... in the .. denominator ? ... I mean no fraction under the -- Oh yeah . ... So then you just multiply , the whole thing by the square root of two , and you get the square root of two over two . ...   Even for the top .. one ? ... Even for that one ? ... No . For- -- I'm talking about for this one . ... Oh . ... All you do is like go , .. t- .. two over one , You have the square root of one , like that , right ? ... Mm . ... Since you have the square root of two on the bottom , ... to make that a square , you have to multiply by the square root of two . ... And then you get two , and you multiply the top by the square root of two , .. and you get , .. square root of two . ...   What . I wanna rewind it and hear that back again .       Cause I sure didn't catch it the first time  . ... You got the two , and you take the square root of two ,  and you get the negative two ,  which you take 3.. the square ,   and it comes to two ,  I'm sorry , ... So . ... let's talk about this slowly , as I write this down , as you're saying it . .. Alright ? ... .. This is what we came out with . Right ? It's -- But put it as the square root of one , ... over the square root of two . .. Oh . .. And then you .. multiply that by the square root of two , over the square root of two . Right .  Uh , is that what all those square root of twos are ? 2 That's what I was try-  --      That's what I was trying to say .   Okay , I was wondering where all that , square root two , square root two ,  That's what it was . Then right here you'd get , ... square root of two .. over two . ... Mhm . ... See everything was ... square root two , over two , and two , Right , but then , .. what about ... this one . on this one . Let me do this one . .. (GULP) But , you have i -- .. you have i square root of three , .. over square root of three . ... I mean z- --   i square root of two over three- -- square root of three  .  I can't even say it right . .. Over , ... do I have another i down here , or just .. the one i . Um , ... no . .. Just one . ... Okay , ... three and square root of three , over square root of three , and you get , ..  ... i square root of six . ... Yeah . ... Over three . ... Is that right ? .. I doubt it . ...  I really do ,      I'm not kidding . .. You can't -- ... You can't multiply , .. square roots like that , can you ? ... Square root of two , .. times square root of three , ... is square root of six , .. is it ? .. Yeah . .. Okay . .. Well , .. then that's fine . .. Then that is right . Isn't that c- -- You can do that . ... Yeah . .. Cause that's the same way you're multiplying there , .. square root of nine , .. that- -- and square root of nine equals three . .. Yeah , ... okay . ... Where's the test . ... There ain't no telling . ... (SIGH) You have it . ... I mean I have it . ...  ... Okay . .. The next one , ... is , ... ... five ex , ... times ... ex minus one , ... (COUGH) Is that it ? ...  um , ... equals , ... two , ... times one minus ex . ...  Leah . ...   Two times one minus ex ? .. Yeah . ... And that's easy , you can do that . ... Oh this is easy . ... Ex squared . ... Please say this will factor ? ... Will it ? ... Na , .. you do it . .. Well , I mean , that's just wasting time . Cause if it's not , Yeah . .. It does ? .. Mhm . ... One and negative twofifths ? .. Mhm . ... And I can always put those back up into the top ,  and , ... and see if they check . Right ? ... Let me just try the one ? ... Five , ... I got zero equals zero .  Tha- that's right .  And that's one ? ... Yeah . ...    None Zero equals zero equals one None . ...  ... Okay . ... Fingerprint file , None you got me down .  Come on . Ex , ... times , .. Hang on . .. Number eight . ... Ex , ... times , .. two minus ex . ... Two minus ex , is less than or equal to , WHISTLE ... I don't like these . three times ex , .. minus four . ... Three times ex , minus four ? .. Right . ... Alright , ... distribute first , right ? Mhm . ... Two ex minus .. ex squared , ... three ex minus twelve , ... you get , ... do that side , so you get .. ex , .. whoa . I don't want to do that . ... Negative ex squared , ... two ex minus  , two minus ex , ... um , plus twelve  , ... ... Now do you factor this ? ... after you do that ? ... Yeah . ... Yeah . ... Oh but first I gotta take out that negative one , don't -- I mean that negative . ... Mhm . in front of that ex squared so I just , .. I can multiply that whole side by .. negative one again though ? .. Yeah . Then you flip that sign over . ... I have to flip that sign over if I do that ? Mhm . ... See it's little rules like that , .. that I'm not gonna remember . ... So if it's a -- .. if it's less than or equal to , then , and there's a minus , you have to flip the sign . ... Okay . ... Are you tired ? ... Not really . ... I mean kind of but , ... I'm gonna go home in just a few minutes . Why . .. Cause I can work on this .. at home , and let you get some sleep . .. ... Ouch . ... .. Okay . ... S so you say ex .. plus four ? ... is greater than or equal to zero  ? ... So you say , ... ex is greater than or equal to , negative four , ... and , ex , ... three . ... Or . ... Oh , is that one of the ones where you have to do or ? .. Yeah . ... And if it's , ... less than , ... do you still do or ? ... No that's if it's um , ... in the , in the b , in between ? ... those two numbers , you know ? ... If there's like a , ... like this one don't look . ... But if there's like a , ... ex .. in the middle .  Well no that's a or . .. If you have like one number on one side , None Mm None . and it says , Yes , greater than or equal to ex , like , and than l , that one's less than or equal to -- like two , .. is less than or equal to ex , is less than or equal to , which is ,  , nan less than or equal to , less tha- -- less than or equal to , .. six . .. Right . ... ... So the final ans- -- So that's the answer . ... Right ? Mhm . ... ... Number nine . ... Okay . .. I don't know this one so , .. You don't know how to do this one ? ... So we in trouble . ... Well you apparently knew how to do it . .. Did I get it right ? ... Well you didn't .. get the whole thing right . ..     But you , Well you just missed one part of it . ... So what's that problem . ... Um , ... absolute value , ... Okay . .. of .. onehalf , ... minus ex over three . ... WHISTLE ... Ex over three , ... oops . ... Okay . ... is less , .. I mean is greater than or equal to , ... twothirds . ... Just .. plain old .. twothirds ? Mhm . ... How do you get rid of the absolute value things ? ... Don't you , I don't -- ... You put , .. is less than or equal to twothirds . ... Or is greater than , ... I mean , .. is greater than or equal to .. twothirds , ... and then , ... don't you have like , .. i- or is less than , ... and is less than or equal to , ... negative two thirds ? ... What ? ... Can I see what I did . ... Yeah . But when you -- .. when you have absolute value , ... when you take the absolute value off , and you put negative two-thirds .. on this side , too , ... First I'll just get a common denominator . ... So I can do that . You can't do it when it's in the .. absolute value ,  though . ... Well I did .. right there . ... Is that why I missed it ? ... But see if you wanna do that , then at first you bring ,  So I only did one part of it in other words . Mhm . ... Just bring nega- -- .. Just bring twothirds , ... over to the other side . Negative twothirds , over to the other side . ... And make it equal to zero ? ... No . No keep that there , .. But then have , Another one over there ? Yeah , have , ... is .. less than or equal to , .. negative two ... thirds . ... And that's not absolute value anymore . ... Well see , ... we've never done it like that .  ... Let me see . ... If that's how you do it . ... I mean I'm sure you probably can do it that way . I don't know , if that's how you do it or not . ... Cause , I haven't done this , ... in probably about as long as you have . .. Oops . ... ... God . ... It's my own fault , I shouldn't have waited . ... so long to get math over with . ... I should've got it over with right out , right out of high school . ... SIP Oo .  ... A bug . ... Hey Leah . ... ... She looks so tired , ... I know . ... She's eating that bug . ...   ... Is that what she's doing ? Yuck . ... I guess . ... Yeah , that's how you do it . ... You can do it that way ? .. Mhm . ... Let me see the pencil . ... But then , I didn't get what she got . ... I guess she -- Yeah , you can put it so . ... square root of that -- .. Oh no , it's not gonna work that way . You don't have it in the middle . .. See I put it in the middle ? .. Seven .. halves , is greater than or equal to- -- But you can't put it in the middle , cause if it's .. gonna be g- -- ... Yeah if it's gonna be greater than that , then it's not gonna be less than that . ... Well I guess it can . ... .. God . ... So one way I could do it  .  Well s- -- .. No . Wait a minute now . See , l- look what she did . ... She um , ... flipped that sign over . ... But , .. uh , ... when she- you divide by negative two , you have to flip all the signs over . ... which you k- did . .. Yeah , cause you got that right , .. it's right here .  Oh gosh . .. You know what , .. I'm just gonna skip this one . ... No you're not , .. you're gonna do it . ... Now . ... So I can't start by d- -- ... Unhunh . .. Not finding a common denominator . You have to ha- bring , Well I can do -- find one side by doing that , can't I ? ... Yeah but , why don't you p- .. just put the other -- ... put -- .. once you have negative two-thirds on the other side , then you can find a common denom- f- na- -- buh buh buh buh , ... common denominator for the whole thing , and it's gonna be the same ... denominator . Well what's the common denominator of bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh .        I didn't mean that . ... I meant once you bring it over there . (SNIFF) I know what you meant . ... I don't ever remember us doing anything like that though . Well add it onto the other side . .. There's like a way you always can get rid of those absolute value bars . ... in problems , isn't there ? ... Hey . ... Can I use some of this ? ... Oh . Yeah . ... Mm . .. See , ... yeah . .. Here it's absolute values . ... Right here . And it's doing it the way that you were doing it ? ... I'm trying to find one like that one . ..  See that's the problem , there's so many different types . ... That , .. I'm sitting here st- worrying about this one right here , and there probably won't even be l- one like this on the test . ... I know . .. There'll be a different one . ... So what do you do . ... You find a inequality , ... with ... an absolute value in it which , there's one right there . ... Mhm . ... See ? ... I sure didn't see any in the -- ... examples . ... Hmm . ... ... See ? .. There's no -- ... There it is .   .. See ? .. Here it is . .. Absolute value of that , .. you brought , ... brought negative four .. over to the other side . ... Okay ... . ... And all that -- See that just proves that she puts problems on there that we've never gone over . ... I know we've never done one like that . .. where you do that , ... Can you -- Do you wanna do that when it's less than , or can you do that when it's greater than too . ... Yeah . ... Th- -- Either way . ... So if it's pointed this way , you just put another one pointing this way over here , ... Right . ... Okay . ... Where'd you get that one . ...  .. That's a big one  .  .. You're not kidding  . That's my thumbnail . ... ... ... ... ... Now I just get a common denominator for the whole thing ? ... Mhm . ... Well , take out those .. absolute value things , they'll screw you up . Yeah . ... And now this'll be six , right ? ... ... Is that right ? ... Mhm . ... Now what do you do . ... Subtract three . .. from the middle . ... And y- -- ... To which side . .. To both sides . .. To both sides ? ... Okay . ... ... Negative  , ... two ex . ... Alright . ... To one , then , after that you have to , take out the negatives . ... Yeah . Divide by -- Well just ta- -- Divide by negative two . ... Oh , you can't get that by ,  ex by itself ? ... Yeah . ... And when you divide by a negative ,  .. you have to flip the signs .  Yeah . .. Okay . ... And when you do that , .. it's gonna be a or . ... Because if you look at it , ... cause , you know , it can't be greater ... than sevenhalves , ... and less than negative halve at the sa , one-half at the same time . ... So it's gonna be either ex , .. is less than or equal to negative ... onehalf , .. or , ... Okay . ... .. ...  ... Will you pass me some of that tea please . ... Oh , thank you . ... SIP SIP ... Number ten . How many problems are on this test . ... Twelve . ... Oh good . ... What did you want to do after this test . ... That's it , .. I guess . ... You gonna study some more tomorrow then , right ? ... Oh definitely . ... Okay . ... Ex plus four , ... over , ... three ex minus two , ... is less than zero . ... Is less than zero . ... Right . ... ... Gosh . ... Is this the c- -- Is this the same class I'm taking Kathy . ... Are you sure we're doing work from the same class that I'm -- that I'm -- that I go to every night . I don't know .   Are we ? ... It's got the same name , but , ... that's about it . ... Okay . ... I don't even know how you start this one , do you ? ... Yeah I think so , but I'm not sure . .. Cause , .. the way I start it , ... Do I -- Did I have anything written on the test ? Mm . ... I left it blank ? ... But , .. But anyways , back to the .. the first thing , Okay . what we were talking about was , Yeah ,  I've gotta pick up Pat ,  .. I l- -- I dropped her off at the bookkeeper , WRITING Uh , ... Uh I would prefer that WRITING , that you were there on one hand , because I think that it would be most expedient . But I think , .. what was .. felt , was that at this point , rather than ha- -- than create -- ... I don't really f find it to be , .. you know , .. a ... confrontation , by any means , but , .. Mhm . I just think , .. they wanna be able to just kind of .. ... figure out , I think our board eh , ... quite frankly we have more ... problems to resolve interior , than we do .. outside of it . .. Hm . I think most of it is just attitudes . Hm .  .. I think , ... you know , like I said , what we need to do , is this board has to realize , ... in my opinion that , .. that they have to come to grips with , the fact that they are responsible , ... for basically what they've created . Mhm . Okay , You know ,  Mhm . You can't th- penalize somebody for 2.. m- --  And the Vetters are somewhat responsible  .  That's right .  3 and that's uh  , Mhm , well it was far beyond our control .   Well , and the thing is I mean ,  That uh , we're we're a different board . .. We are not the same . Yeah . And we have to do that ,  That's right . but we have to realize that there's , the faults here , .. we have to claim responsibilities . I mean , Mhm . I think there was , .. there's manners of- of speaking that I was very outspoken about , at this meeting , you know , w- that I talked .. to .. uh Bill and Carmela and Nancy about , .. you know , and they --  -- we did -- they asked me to meet with them about ... Teresa's thing . .. Mhm .  ... that .. I find v- really , ... nothing , ... to be honest , .. nothing of any validity .  Well I -- you know , .. Okay . I have spoken twice with Teresa . Did you , .. Unhunh . Yeah . ..  And I told her exactly -- .. well , i t- I simply told her what , what I know ... to have happ- -- and I -- it's -- to me it's n- just ludicrous . and I -- anyway , we -- w- we went through the whole thing , and , uh , ... and and I also said , that it would probably , be brought up , at board retreat , or , DI don't know . .. Uh --  Well I None None I'm gonna write a letter to Teresa ,  Uh , ..   .. um  , just to tell her that l , you know . .. d- Thank you for your l- -- you know , y what you've done for the board and so forth , Mhm . and just say , you know , I'm hoping , we are gonna address .. this .. letter of concerns that you've given us .  Mhm . ... Um , she's asked that , ... you know , she want- -- she didn't really want her things to be kind of everywhere . .. You know those th- -- Mhm . what her comments . She really wanted em to be within this TAP p- committee TAP .  Mhm . ... nan my f- -- Summarized ? .. or something like that I guess ? S- they were her summar- -- her summary , th- you know . She , .. kyu- very- m- very concisely , Yeah . I don't know if she put it together , or if nancy put it together . But , Mhm . .. you know , that just says , .. they -- I d- -- I really had a ho- -- everybody there , including .. Nancy . .. Mhm . You know . .. Uh had very .. little .. to- to -- .. you know , .. to agree with the validity . .. Okay ? Yeah . It was a matter of -- ... I just don't , you know , ... see .. where this is coming from . Yeah . It's -- ..    Okay , you know , these are- -- these are rooted , I know . Jeez . obviously in a personal .. issue , ..  Yeah . ... Um , Teresa is a very sensitive person , ... she f- -- .. you know , .. I don't -- I have no doubt that she believes , ... what happened happened . But ,  Well but , My- .. my feeling is , .. as I told them , I said , if it's that issue , .. I says , .. you know , ... I said let's just get real here . .. I said , Yeah . we all know Brad , ... I said , we all know Teresa , I said , and I don't know anybody on this board who does not tiptoe around Teresa . ... Period . Yeah . .. Unhunh .  I says , I don't know anybody who would even go as far as to say .. anything of that nature , .. I said ,  and , .. there- -- it was very clear . You know . ... She kept saying , ... prefacing everything with , .. you know , this is not a personal attack . .. This is not a personal  2.. vendetta , Yeah , yeah yeah yeah . Right . Right .  .. Which tells you , .. that it is . Yeah . That's immediately what it said . And that's what everybody perceived it . Yeah .  2.. There --  Yeah , there have been some uh , .. I'll te- -- well it goes back to , if you can believe it I ha- -- I know .. she -- there was a .. a -- .. We had a number of people .. once , at a party , uh , like half of the board- -- it was a big mistake  of mine , Yeah . and I know , .. she felt really snubbed , and uh , Mhm ? and it was -- and I- I called her in fact , later . And I said Teresa . Thi- .. this was not a w- -- I invited people that helped with the market that .. year , Mhm ? I think it was two years ago , And I know , .. I mean that wa- really upset her . ... And jeez . If that's gonna upset her ,  Uh ,   Well that's .. that's the thing that ,  but anyway . that see and the other thing that I've gotta do , too , is I wanna make sure , like , for example , ... Donna's aware that she is not gonna be at this retreat . Mhm . See I have not called her , ... but I'm gonna call her to tell her .. that . Mhm . Yeah . You know , we're having a board retreat . .. you know , Right . that it's not gonna include staff , if that's what we decide . Right . .. Unhunh .  ... And what we will do , is I think , .. what we're gonna probably wanna do , or what I would like to do , is I would like to take a day . Mhm .  ... d during the week , and we'll just take a whole day . .. That day . And myself , uh , if we have a uh facilitator , .. Mhm .  Um , that that person , you and Patricia and .. D Donna , .. Mhm , and maybe one other , or two other board members would , .. actually spend that day and just say okay , this is what went on at that retreat . Mhm .  These are the concerns , Yeah . .. These were comments , .. nan these are the ones that we feel we can address . .. These are the ones that pertain to you . Unhunh , ... Yeah .  None  I- I am concerned Phil that ,  ... you mentioned it yesterday . That ... that there may be .. a number of questions , .. that ... just cannot be answered . .. Without ... me ... being there . Yeah , ... I .. I- I think it's -- Hi None gato None . ...  .. You know I'm gonna have -- Okay .  Can we talk l- -- uh , .. I bet Pat's gonna -- she's gonna start walking back to the office . Yeah .  I dropped her at the bookkeeper . .. W- .. w- .. why don't you call me , at least a little bit later maybe , Yeah . and we can go do that . Can I do that , Cause I -- .. she'll be --  Ji- .. Jim and I are gonna have lunch , Uh -- .. I don't want to get her uh -- I don't know if you have plans or not . But , we're gonna have lunch later ,  at noon . .. Sure  . If you wanna join us , it'd be great . sure . .. Yeah .  3.. um , 3.. you wanna do it , where -- .. what's the -- I -- you know , I don't -- my- my feeling is , I'm trying to , .. I think , .. what I wanna do , is -- ... my- my .. point of wanting to push this retreat , I think it was really important was , Mhm , to do it to e- -- .. .. to make it sound like we're taking it seriously . .. Oh yeah . But .. to also ... put into perspective , and see , w- that was one point of view why , Yeah . you know , Like I said d- d- the facilitator , in in the beginning , I did not -- .. wasn't really in support of one . And only because I felt , Mhm . I wanna make it sound important , It would formalize it too much ? Or None , 2..  I want -- it formalizing it , but it's also say- -- I want it to come to the resolution that , .. things aren't that bad . Mhm . ... No . None and that what None -- I -- what we -- and things aren't that bad . The thing is that we h- do have our attitudes . Mhm . Mhm .  Okay , Mhm . 3.. We have an attitude , you know , even what Ray's attitude with .. with Barbara . .. Mhm .  is completely .. unheard of , you know and I'm -- that bothers me a great deal . Jeez . .. I just couldn't believe that .  When I heard it . I- None -- .. I had , you know , .. I came real close to calling Ray , and just sitting and talking with him about it , Yeah . but I figured no , Yeah . ... I'm just gonna blow it off . I think , 3.. he's off the board ,  I'm gonna blow it off , 4.. he's -- I'm not gonna give m- -- Yeah . you know , .. we've done .. everything we needed to do , Right . Right . I think , you know , what Barbara told me was that , .. Dolores was incredibly embarrassed , ... by his display , .. at this time in front of her . .. Dolores apologized for Ray to him , Really . Oh gee .  So Dolores is obviously aware that , Oh gosh . ... you know , and ,  .. Yeah , she says , I don't know why he resigned , I don't know what's got in -- because he's been miserable , ... ...  .. because -- w- .. which we know , Mhm , .. that's why he was- kept trying to get involved and make it sound , you know , like he -- .. and nyou know , he was trying to make it sound like , same old complaint , same old everything , well , ... we didn't have any complaints .  Yeah .  I think this is one of the first years , I know .  that this has been so ooth . And I think , had we realized it , Mhm . .. we would have allowed him to take a break ... four years ago . Yeah . Yeah . .. Yeah . .. Because , .. and it wasn't so much- -- it wasn't , you know like I told Jim , I said it wasn't anything .. .. that POUND you POUND did , .. wasn't anything .. else . Mhm . I said , it was a matter of , you know , mBrad did , .. and Pat did , the organization , .. I said , .. which was the best thing . I th- I agree with that . Mhm . .. I think that was the best thing to do , Mhm . It was a lot of time . .. Yeah .  .. But I think , ... we need to -- we need to d- establish ... duties . ... Mhm . You know . Which we decided . .. And see part of what we decided with these duties is , .. just deciding , ... what we need .. to do what . .. You know . There's gonna be tasks . Mhm .  As specifically as we ca- --  None  yeah . See and I'm .. I'm -- .. on one hand I'd like to take it back to where the secretary is responsible for the minutes .  Unhunh . You know . .. Pat does that , Yeah , I know . There's -- .. really the secretary serves almost no function . Just i- th- not . You know I , it's just uh , 2.. There signs -- she signs her name thirty times , Yeah , you know , in the last f- y- -- Right .  Right Phil . two days ago .  Well ,  That was it . .. That was it .  That's a problem . That um -- I -- you know , and I think we wanna do that . We need to say . ... You know , Pat's been great enough to do this , ... and if she really wants to do it . .. I'm not gonna nan dissuade her from doing it . Yeah .  But one thing we have to be careful of , Yeah . that I mentioned .. to Jim , and I've mentioned it to Pat lightly . .. Yeah . Which is .. to be careful about  saying things . You know , like in board meetings ? .. In- interjecting too much . .. Yes . Okay ?  I know . Because in board discussion , .. I mean , Yeah . o- on one hand , as a member she has every right . To- .. to speak what she wants . .. But , Mhm . .. No . But that's -- The thing is , .. you know . I've just seen .. some of the looks , .. from some of the people , you know , who feel , I'm a board member . Yeah .  And whether -- the board you know , if they don't interject anything , but whether they do or not . .. I think we have to be careful , .. Mhm . .. Well Phil , that , .. I mean that goes -- be- because , .. where that came in , That goes for me as well then . It -- Yeah , it does . But , It um , I think what's different is , You -- um , .. you've been much more responsive in this sense . I mean , .. Okay ? Pat's more opinionated in that sense . You know I -- Unhunh . Okay ?  I -- .. what I try to do , is .. is is just respond to question- --    -- and if I need to fill in blanks , which , Oh yeah . That's fine . You know . That -- But -- See but that -- .. your -- .. your position .. is different . Mhm .  Okay ? .. That's -- Yeah that's TRUE . Yours is in a -- .. is a much more official capacity , because you are the one who answers to the board . Yeah . Right . You have to do that . .. And you are- th- can voice an opinion about things .  Yeah . But the biggest deal , .. where I thought it was an issue , th- where I heard things about it was , .. during the annual meeting , right after , when we had the discussion about the poster . .. Oh .  When we brought up the thing , Was Pat uh -- Pat was right in the middle of it , See , I -- 2.. I wasn't there ,  and she was saying , well this is a great piece , and this is this . Well , .. Yeah . you know , .. I didn't wanna embarrass her , She shouldn't have done that . and I didn't wanna do anything . I know . But I just saw ,  people kinda going , That was out -- .. Yeah . You know ? Yeah . And ,  That's TRUE . She shouldn't've been in on that at all . She shouldn't've been , you know , cause that's not part of her capacity , she's not on that committee , Mhm . Mhm . you know , and if she wants -- you know , .. basically the thing is , you know , if she wanted to be a board person . Mhm . That's fine . I mean let's look into b- pursuing that . Right . Right .  But see I'm afraid we're gonna lose Jim because of that . ... he feels there's a conflict . And uh , it's definitely gonna happen .  I mean he says . .. There's no question about it , we've talked , Yeah , and maybe it's right . .. Maybe it s- it is gonna be right . Yeah . .. You know ? .. Well he -- ... d -- I mean he doesn't seem to -- .. you've talked to him and I've talked to him and ,  Well , .. he seems to be -- I mean he says mayb- -- you know , after the board retreat . now . Yeah . .. But not , Well I a- -- you know , I wanted him , I said I want you to stay through the board retreat . .. Yeah . I says , and the reason is , because I said we need people who know , I said right now we have , ... You know , .. four new board members ? .. Or five . Yeah . .. You know , .. Yeah . Four , whatever . .. Four new board -- .. yeah .  .. And , ... we're at this point of saying okay . Uh , .. ... ... All of a sudden , .. we have t- all these , .. you know , questions to answer . Mhm . You know . we have all these things that we have to do , Mhm . and we have this commitment of time . ... Uh , ... and but they don't know , everything that's gone on , in the last .. years . They need to be educated as to --  See this , no . .. no . this retreat , that's why you see , I think it's important . .. Because , ... I mean I realized , .. that I'd never seen the bylaws , .. since I was on the board until .. I asked for a copy . Mhm . Mhm . Right . ... Yeah . ... Now what I -- .. what I have done though , is to , .. you know , .. any new board member that .. jumps on , I send them , Good . ... copies of the --  because , .. I wanna -- .. Yeah . I wanna get these 2.. books , but ty- -- 2.. typically they no one reads em  .  Well that's fine .  You know . But it's -- At least they've got -- But I think , what I wanna do is , I'm gonna -- I wanna draft a letter . ... Mhm . Like I said which , Mhm . None says to them you know , this is what we're doing , this is the purpose of this retreat . Mhm .  .. To new board members , and , .. you know , .. board members , for a while it was , we need to find out .. what it is we're doing . .. Yeah . Whether we're doing .. something right or not . You know , Right . .. Right . I think we are . .. B- but , Oh yeah . .. Sure we are . I think , Sure we are . the thing is , nan .. I don't -- ... I need to b- -- .. them to .. kind of commit . .. To ... to being responsible . Mhm . .. Yeah . .. And uh , .. I mean I kinda hate to feel like I'm taking .. charge , but th- I guess that's what I'm .. I'm needing to do . .. Well yeah for -- You know but , y- .. y- .. you do , and you're --  .. and that's .. kind of why I'm -- and you're present . .. I'm going to assign things . Unhunh . you know , at some point we're gonna have committees , .. and we're gonna have , .. you know , .. Mhm . b .. people , .. that'll be given tasks . Yeah . You know , Specifically . Yeah .  Like , you know , I didn't need to do all this calling aro- .. to find a r- a r- retreat space , but I figured , .. if I don't do it , That's right .  it's gonna fall on you or pat . .. Yeah . .. Of course . .. Yeah . You know . And normally that's .. that's what happens . None That's okay but , I mean , .. uh , You know , I I'm a- I'm a- -- I'm aware of a lot of the things that are going on . .. You know , Yeah . I know that you're getting ready to leave , and Pat's .. doing things so , I'd better let you go get her . Yeah . .. I know . Okay . And we'll continue this . Well , .. yeah . There -- In some manner , but we don't have to talk about it at lunch if you don't want . But I think , No , that's fine . if we can , ..  That's fine . .. If we can go ahead and carry on , Um , ... at some point , you and I I think , Yeah .  Because -- One thing that comes to mind is , .. is the , .. well the question of .. meeting quarterly , .. is that .. enough . ... Meaning having , you know .. the -- .. It would be enough if committees were to meet . None uh , If committees yeah . ... and .. that's the -- but -- .. that -- ... that's -- .. that was Paul's .. uh .. desire . ... And I think , was uh -- .. that's what we wanna talk ab- --  we'll talk about that there too . And say look , Mhm . you know , is quarterly -- ... you know , we- would we need to meet every other month . Mhm . You know , do we need t- -- do we need to meet , you know , .. as a full board every oth- -- w -- We shouldn't have to . We shouldn't . If the committees , ... uh ,  but these committees need .. to be active , function properly . .. and to do their things .  Right . Basically , you know , the publications committee , needs to be more involved than just making decisions on what we publish .  Yeah . You know , .. Yeah . .. They need to become .. somewhat selfsufficient . .. Collections committee . ...  needs , .. you know . .. I would like to create .. collections committee to be something where we're almost matching ? ... Yeah . .. .. Funds they can raise maybe ? .. Unhunh . ... Yeah . You know . If they can raise ten grand . Well , ..   you know , and have some -- I mean realistically -- have some incentive . Right . For them to -- yeah . So that basically they'd be , they'd get to a point of saying , ... Mhm . Okay we need to be responsible with this , so that .. collections , Yeah . and publications will be all .. fund raising too .  Right .  Oh boy Phil , that's -- nan Yeah , it's not gonna be pretty , Yeah , that's where -- .. Because that's --  You know also , we may consider , you know , we have one board .. opening . And I -- .. we may think about Gail , .. Well Gail is very interested , and so is this -- we met with another person by the name of Bill Ashby . ... Hm . ... Yeah I know ,  Jack and I and Jim .. met with him . .. Oh , you mean his , .. Jack's financial friend that -- Jack's friend . .. is retired . Yeah . .. He's a banker , Yeah . .. and he'd be good on one hand . .. But , Yeah . I would like , ideally  I'd want em both . .. Yeah . ... Yeah . You know . .. And , ... I'm hoping ,  Yeah I -- what I'm gonna nan .. what I'm anticipating doing is uh -- this retreat .. might urge people .. to say , I'm not interested in doing that much work . Yeah . ... And so I'm getting , yeah .  And .. it might just f- ... get .. like Nancy .. and Kay , .. I mean I like Kay  ,   See Nancy was going off . She -- she told me she was going off this year . And she uh , and Kay convinced -- .. said well Nancy you can't leave right away , and uh , .. uh , .. she said okay , I'll stay another year . .. But , .. I don't .. know why . You know , and -- and then we can -- .. nan why -- tha- -- I think that's very important to discuss . .. At the board .. retreat .   I think it is , because , I mean , the thing is that we need to get to a point and , the reason we've set terms is because , .. basically , .. people here ,  Mhm . majority of us have been here a long time . Yeah . .. That's right . .. You know , .. and , .. there's a point -- well that's why we have this , the term limitation . .. Unhunh .   I'm -- .. I -- I'm uh full agreement , cause I'm ready . .. You know ? Yeah . I've agreed to do this term , Yeah . .. Mhm . .. but , .. Mhm . my feeling is , I'm ready , ... for .. a year off . Yeah . You know . Mhm . and I'll still be volunteering , .. but , I really am ready for , some time to say . Mhm . You know , and I wanted Jim to consider being market manager , even if he goes off the board . .. Yeah . .. I know , he was wavering a little bit on that , .. whether or not he would volunteer , .. at the marketing center . .. Yeah . I mean there's None -- I've gotta run now . Okay . j- -- See you Brad . Um , .. but , .. the lun- -- .. uh ,  We're gonna meet here . ... Oh you're gonna have x -- so we can d- either swing by for you , or we can decide , we'll call you . ... Oh -- ... so you're not -- when I know what we're doing , if you want , ... Okay , that'd be great . ... Alright ,  -- Talk to you in a bit . ... Sam has been , .. has taken such an interest in this retirement bit . .. ... That it -- .. it really surprises me . .. Well she's begun to listen . .. Yes she has . You know , She has . ... uh , she used to .. go over and read a book , Yeah or , or something . b- turn a deaf ear . That was for sure .   But uh , ... once you understand it , .. you know you , (SNIFF) you're interested in getting right in , and going after it . Yeah . .. I really oughta call , at least Reg Barr , and ask if uh , ... he's still speaking to me , ..   Well now he was the one that was up on the left . Yeah . 2.. Up there . 2.. Yeah . Yes .  Well he came over to you all iles , I noticed . Nyes . .. Well , we've known each other for thirty some years , why wouldn't he . But a- anyway , .. um , ... I was so glad that he opened up on this disclosure bit . ... because it was POUND Burns that's been objecting to our having it POUND . ... Oh ? .. And I knew this . .. So when he opened up on that , and she followed through , and told about her husband , ... you know ? ... Not necessarily that she would approve of it , ... but at least she wasn't disapproving nan .. Yeah . nan .. of it . Yeah . ... And uh , ... course Duvall might- -- nan And I- -- .. I cannot get over this . ... That man . .. I really cannot . .. And you know , .. he must have been thinking , ... when he said he wasn't a political appointee , he must have been associating .. his relationship .. with .. Steitler . MIC ... Oh . MICROPHONE ... I really do believe that . Mhm . ... In his thinking . ... I don't know how else he could have .. done it . That ... topples over . MICROPHONE ... Um ,  but he didn't say that . .. Oh , ... He said I loved your hum- .. humor , ... uh , ... and I love you , .. but , ... I am not a political appointee . And his eyes were just ping .  And I said oh ?   How did you get on the board .   Well he said , I got a letter from the governor .. asking .  ...  Everybody on there is an app- political appointee ,  .. that wasn't the point . ...  The point was , ... I could have mentioned what was in the paper about him , that he was related , you know , had business with Steitler , .. And I just said , and there's .. Doctor Duvall , .. .. you know ? ..   .. And then I went to Rotus , ... who's a seasoned ... politician , Yeah . .. if there ever was one , ...  he just would flare  . .. And I said , well I- -- Alright . I said , I'll apologize next time . ... And I'm gonna make hay out of it . Don't you worry . ..    I wanna know how you birds got on that board , if you're not political appointees   .  (SNIFF)    Mm . Oh my . ... Can I grow some basil ? ... From seed ? ... Yes , that's how I -- I don't have any this year , but I've grown it other years . ..  Well -- There's no problem . It will not take any frost . Soon as the b- -- .. Yeah I- -- A little bit of frost , ... it's gone . I l- -- I learned that . ... one time the- -- I learned it just went down . the hard way . Hm ? ... Uh huh . Yes ? Well I think it was Barbara that ... has some seeds . ... Just- -- No problem . It comes right up . Yeah . ... Yeah . ... Isn't that what you gave the neighbor one time ? I- -- ... You gave him some kind of herb . Did I give him some -- .. I gave him a red pepper . ... I think you- -- I think you gave him ... some ... herb of some kind . I may have given- given him some basil , yes . Yeah , .. I don't have any this year , I forgot to plant it , ... I have oregano , .. Yeah . a good stand of it , if you want any , ... Yeah . ... I have a lot of dried ... or- oregano .  .. Is your cigarette out , ... everybody's . .. Yeah , it's out . ... You oked it down into the .. cork , didn't you . ... Pardon ? .. You oked it down into the cork . .. Well , yeah , you don't like that .  Do you but -- .. No , It chokes me to death . It --  It's there , might as well oke it . ... Oh . ..  ... No good . .. No good . ... Uh ,   ... how's Ted doing . ... He's keeping very busy , he's on mostly uh evening hours , ... Mhm .  they're redoing the pharmacy there at Wel- Wallmart . Oh ?  ... Enlarging it . ... And , .. Well , it's close to the garden shop , ... and so the fellows in the garden shop , and the pet shop , have to ... move things out from that area , oh . into the garden shop , so they can work .. on the ... pharmacy . Well they needed to expand the pharmacy , I've never been there , but , .. what I had to wait and wait and wait . ... So I don -- ... Where are they putting the pharmacy . Well they're b- .. leaving it in the same place , they're just .. taking out two rows of , ... of uh , ... S -- where the ... toiletries were . ... Yeah . ... Just inventory stuff . ... Moving it . None .. They're -- they're moving that . I don't know where , where they're going to put all that . .. Hm .  ... But Ted says there's not much garden left . (SNIFF) Just , ... all of this stuff , ... out in there , .. he works uh .. six days next week , ... ...  instead of five days ,  . he only gets one day off . Hm . .. Mhm . He's off today . .. Mhm . ... And uh , ... Well , but he hasn't had day hours , he's been working ... evening hours and weekends . ... you know , ... I think I'd hate to be in business right now . ... Oo . .. You can't .. sit .. still . ... Hmm . ... You have to expand , ... or something , ...  to keep ... in the main stream . ... ... Well , and so many times when they expand , they've expanded , and then things dropped back . ... Yeah . ... But this Wallmart needs , .. needs a larger building . .. Yeah .  It's just too cramped . Your shirt and beads .. are most becoming . ..  Well you know , I think they weigh about a quarter of an ounce . And that's the right kind of beads , Unhunh . .. for summer . .. A little girl the other day , ... remarked about them , and , ... almost on impulse , ... but I didn't do it . ... I thought I'd pull em off , just give em to her if she liked em that well .   You know .  But then I thought , ... these are the only summer beads I have . Right . .. And I like -- I like that b- .. shirt . ... You know what I had to do . ...  This -- What did you -- ... this -- .. See where I sewed right down the middle of that . .. Yeah ? ... Otherwise it would balloon out ? ... And so I s , .. put it on the machine , and sewed right down through the middle of it .  So it doesn't gap . (COUGH) So it .. d- doesn't gap-  . .. Right . ... Oh , art . ... Yeah . ... Well it works . ... art .  It had a , it had a , ... one of those ... bottoms that -- ... Oh . are -- ... what do you call it . .. A tail ? ... No . The tight . It- None (%) the band . Oh . The t- the tight band around the bottom of it . B- band . I don't like those . ... I don't either . ... Makes your butt look thin . Most all of em are that way . Makes your hei- --  And do you know , makes your heinie look thinner . ... I went over to a store , ... where it says , .. uh sewing , ... alterations . ... And all that stuff . And I said , how much do you charge , ... for taking that .. bottom band off the top , .. you know . .. And just making it a straight shirt . ... And she said , THUMP eight dollars . .. And I thought , oh my lord , I didn't pay that much for the top I've got on .    You know , ... that's a little like these catalog things . I saw something in a cat- -- the ... catalog , this USPE deal that , ... I've been with for a long time , and , ... I wanted to buy it , .. It was a m , m- like a muumuu , ... Mhm . weren't those pretty ones up , in Dillards the other day , those muumuus , did you notice em ? ... Didn't you notice em , as you went out , ... all beautiful colors ? ... So pretty . .. Well anyway , they were on the rack . ... And uh , ... I wanted to order that muumuu , ... I mean it was around twenty-nine dollars , or something like that , .. and two pairs of short pajamas . ... One for Sam , and one for me . ... And , ... I looked at the postage .. attached to it , .. and I thought good heavens . It would have been around eight dollar . It's by .. amounts of POUND money nan . ... Not weight . It's by money . .. nan How much money this costs . ... And it's geared according to that POUND . ... And I thought , forget it . I could take that eight dollars , and buy another whole .. outfit . ... Yeah , .. you know , this is amazing . Uh , .. I like to get um ... pillow covers . .. That you zip on , to protect the pillows ? Mhm . ... Mhm . ... And uh , .. I went over to Sears , ... one time , and ordered three . ... Through the ... catalog ? ... And instead of sending it in with a shipment or anything ,  .. I paid postage on it separate . .. Yeah . And do you know the postage came to more nan nan ... Than the g- -- than the product . .. more than the product . Right . ... Right . ...  .. Well I -- I w- -- ... That's one of the letters that I'm going to write to USPE . ... .. And just tell them . ... That they're gearing this in the wrong way . ... It should be geared according to weight . ... Now . ... That g- ... cotton -- .. two pairs of cotton pajamas , ... and that cotton .. muumuu , .. ain't gonna weigh up to eight dollars worth , Believe  you me . I wouldn't think , No . I know better . .. So , ... I thought th , .. I just won't ... order from em . I m- -- ... That's .. foolish . We better go up to Dillards , and see if they still have those muumuus . ... You mean up to Phoenix ? ... No , well- they might have them here , in town . .. I don't know . At Dillards . .. They -- they were sure pretty . ... Pretty c- -- .. pretty colors . .. Some of em were dark , Yeah . Yeah . but they had , .. oh , .. purples and , reds and , .. pinks and , oh , pretty designs in em . Hm . .. You didn't see em . ... I don't think I was- -- I was -- ... I think I was concerned about your getting there and back .  Oh . Oh , hunh ,  You're not the only one baby  .    You weren't the only one ,  Sam , I was just dripping -- ... I was just soaked . Buckets ? .. I was just absolutely soaked . .. Wasn't I . .. Yeah . She c- came in , and sat down in the restaurant , (COUGH) You know and spent , ... the first ten or fifteen minutes , None   stopping the flow of --  ... trickling down her neck .  Oh ,  Oh terrible . ... Just terrible . ... Oh well . ...  I -- .. My other Doris .. does the same thing . ... Oh does she ?  . Yeah . ... Well what is it . ... I don't know . She doesn't know . Well some people just perspire nan Well I didn't persp- 2.. use to perspire like that , nan more , .. but I sure have done it nan .. no , not to that extent you didn't . nan recently .  Th- that , .. and the time we were up in uh , ... M- Montgomery Wards . Remember ? Oh yes . Oh boy was I soaked . ... That was just nan And that was in the winter . nan .. weakness . ... Exertion . ... Well maybe that's what this was . .. But anyway .   I wish the stores would open earlier .  Earlier . ... Yes . .. I do too . Instead of ten o'clock , in the summertime they oughta open at least at nine ,   Well it would he- -- I'd say eight . .. it would help . Eight o'clock would be fine . you hate to start out ... at ten o'clock . I'd say eight , .. and quit at four . ...   You know the little folks who live above me ,  Mhm . ... go over to .. Tucson Mall , and walk every morning . (SNIFF) Yeah . .. That's good .  And there's a side door , ... Mhm . .. Unlocked . So that they can go in , ... oh I think -- A lotta people do that . ... They go r uh- at least by eight o'clock .  .. Yeah . ... And they go in , They go in and walk . ... and then they know  , so many times around , you know , Mhm . .. Mhm .  will um , ... make a mile . ... And then there's a , .. soft drink place up there that they all congregate . Oh .  And uh , ... Why don't you join em . ... and they have pins , when they cover fifty miles , or whatever you know , Yeah , and a hundred miles of ,   What outfit is this from . Oasis ? .. No , no , it's a- -- it's just a neighborhood thing . .. It's just people around in that area , it's n -- and they go there to walk .  I think . ... I think that's it . ... But uh , ... I- -- uh -- we've been over there , and we've seen em go in , ... and all they're doing is just walking . ... Mhm . ... They might be good people , we could cultivate to .. hunt things for us . ...     Yeah . 3 You mean look in the window   . Now that's -- that's an idea . ..   .. Instead of having to parade all around looking for it ,  6.. they're around , why not tell us where that is . Well yeah , well they can explain ,    and they can take notes ,  as they go around , 9.. (%) 9.. Of course . ...  Make it pay off .  Be glad to shop for you .  Charge a fee . .. Right .    (SNIFF)   nan I still haven't found anybody that wants to , ... let me pay a little fee , and then , ... call em every morning , ... that I'm .. up and around . ... What what what w- -- .. Back up a minute . Do what ? ...  I- -- You'll pay .. to be called ? I've been looking for somebody , who will sit by the phone in the morning , ... and a- -- ... and clients will call in and say , good morning , I'm up . ...  .. And so th- -- .. they're through for the day then . .. I'm up . If I don't call in by say nine o'clock , ...  Then --  well I'll be glad to do that for a fee . ... You will ?  How much is the fee though .    3..  Angela ,  I don't m-  -- it- -- does that b- -- does it really bother you ? ... I'd like to have somebody I could call in to , .. every morning . You call in , .. or I call in . I call in and let you- -- ... whoever it is , know I'm up . Well , Oh . you can do that with us . .. We're up  -- You can do it with  -- nan you can do that with us , ... sometimes we're up at four o'clock . ..    we're up early . (SNIFF) 3..  .. ... Well , I would like to have it on a business basis with somebody . Well , well alright . We'll put it on a business basis . ... You will ? ... Yeah . ... It's on a business basis right now . Well , We just formed a corporation  . I'll None -- I'll draw up the papers . You do that .   You do that . We'll have them witnessed , .. and ,  .. w- w- we're in business . .. Should we have an attorney to advise us . ... Oh , I think I can do that .   .. ..  Oh . ...  ... What else were you cooking in there . ... Just the bread pudding . I made uh , ... bean salad for us for lunch . ... Oh you did . .. You like beans . Ah yes . ... Onions in it ? .. Oh yes , and pickles , Le- -- ... And egg , And eggs listen . ... I've found out , ... that ... I can enhance , ... various dishes that I cook , ... if I use my onion powder and garlic powder . .. Not .. the onion salt , ... but the -- .. the onion powder . Onion powder None . And you shake it on . .. Yeah , .. And I've -- ... Other day , somebody was eating lunch at my house , ... and I put some onion powder ... in the mayonnaise , .. and put it on some .. boiled eggs . ... Opened em up , and I didn't stuff the eggs . I just put that mayonnaise on top . And they said , oh that's good . How did you do that . ... Yeah . Hunh . ... So remember . ... I don't have any onion powder . And it's not very expensive either . I have garlic powder . You can find it in Wallgreens , in great big bunches of stuff . ... There about . ... Yeah I , ... Well , .. I got the word the other day , that I gotta cut salt . ... Oh you've been telling me that all along , and I've been trying to do it , I b- thought I'd b- b- was doing pretty well . But he -- .. I don't think the man knows uh what he's about . ... I mean you know  --  A- aren't you going to see him soon ? .. Again ? ... I just saw him . She saw him Monday , and , .. and then .. in two months .  I had a a , ... an ray , what . ... ray , Heart -- an EKG , and bloodwork . ... Really .  Well is the do- -- They haven't called you on the blood . No . ... We should get a , .. a paper today . They were gonna send a ... copy . .. Uh , ... that -- ... Excuse me , I've got the hiccups . ...  .. ... He said uh , take nan ... the uh , ... what do you call it ? ... The water pill . .. Diarrhetic . ... Take .. one of the capsules , and two of the white . ... Las- .. Lazex ? Or something like -- Lazix ? Hunh ? .. Lazix ? Lazix . .. but I'll be taking the generic drug . Of it . ... In the morning . .. Then in the afternoon , take the capsule and one .. one Lazik . Mhm . .. She did that yesterday . I can't do it . My stomach ... gives me trouble , ... I cramp , ... Well what --  -- ... Are are you eating Tums , ... for calcium ? No . .. I'm not eating Tums .   I have- -- ... Oh I did take , .. I did s- -- ... call out last night , and say l , .. make a note for potassium though . Do you have one of those little things that has a compartment in it for each day . No . ... No . ... Heaven sakes . ..  ... I'm not a very good pill taker , I'm re- -- .. I think I'm resenting , I'm not either , but I have --  I'm resenting this medicine . (COUGH) And I think it's contributing to my problems . I really do . ... I think that .. the .. cardazam is , .. I think that the .. d- diarrhetic is , ... ... Well now your , your ankles were down this morning and your legs . Well yes . They are . They were . ... Now look at em . ... Now they're s- ... tight again . ... Oh , did I tell you , .. No . What . ... that  --   that the spring broke in my recliner ?  Oh yes .  Oh yes . You've told us that . And 3.. Dorsen's fixed it ?  You got it fixed up ? And -- and two men came in , and wrestled it all over the floor ? ... And they found out , ... that , ... it was easier , .. they went back out the truck , and got a g- -- .. a whole assembly , for one side . The- the- the- -- ... Mhm . .. You know . Makes the  -- Was this on the seat or the back . makes the feet go out . ... The the the f- -- .. the footrest goes out . You know there's a -- ... a .. a mechani there . Yeah . ... So they put a whole new mechani in on side . Hm . And I wasn't prepared for them to -- ... I was going to tip them , ... but I wasn't prepared . ... To b- .. buy the chair .  Over again  .    S-  so    -- No .  I gave em ten dollars , but that's all I had . ... Well that was enough . I guess that was enough . ... I  -- They're on salary with the c- -- ... with the company anyway . Yeah . Sure . ... But they were so jovial , and nan Yeah . Was that spring from your seat or the back of th- your chair . nan nice . ... Now , it was a , ... a tight little spring , .. that um , (SIGH) .. governed the mechani . ... And held the chair together , ... when you .. put out nan ... Oh , the footrest . nan the footrest . ... And I told -- ... Well I think I told you this . I phoned her and said , ... I don't know whether I can sit in the chair at all or not . ... And .. I said , .. and besides , when I go by it , it snarls at me . ...    And , and she --  sh- she said , well it's alright to sit on it , but don't put the ... footrest out .  ..  nan ... How are we on the -- ...  ... I can't tell when it's done . Well , it'll stop . ... It looks like it's done . ... Oh honey no . ... It goes for forty-five minutes . Well the- -- Yeah , but it's all over here . .. It's not the -- See , when that's empty , that's done . .. ... Well , .. maybe we've talked for forty-five minutes . ... I don't know whether it's to go off , or not . ... Does it automatically go off at the end of -- I thought it did . ... Yeah , .. well that's what -- Well , maybe it does . that's what it is .  Are you ready for a little lunch ? ...  Oh . Why sure- -- ... Are you ready ? Y- -- yes , I'm hungry . Okay . ... Whatever . What else . ... Politics deals with the question of power . right ? ... That's the introduction to empowerment . .. What is power . ... Very quickly , come on , ... all of you should know these two concepts , .. they're not that difficult , ... What is power . What are we talking about . .. Having the capacity to impact public policy . Alright . So if we're talking about politics , politics is tied into the whole concept of power . right ? ... And if we're talking about .. empowerment as a concept , we must have an understanding of the notion of what is power . Now does .. power come in one form , does it come in many different forms . ... Different . ... Different forms . .. Back here . ... What forms . ... Give me examples of power . ... Either one of you . ...   .. Education , ... knowledge , Alright , .. knowledge , knowledge . ... Okay , .. what else . ... Um , Money . ... um , ... your .. position in the workforce ? .. Um , Okay , I'm trying to think of the word . Alright . ... Close . Right . Wealth , .. numbers , Wealth . numbers of people , Numbers of people . .. right ? ... What else . ... Social status . .. Social status , .. position , .. right ? If you're the chairperson of um .. a major corporation ? .. would you say that that person ... has some power ? ... Most definitely . .. Alright . .. Especially if you're in uh IBM , or General Motors , or .. Chrysler Corporation and , I think in some nan .. some t nan .. some examples , some , ... gender and race , ... can give you power . ... Gender race , alright . Gender nan Let's deal with that . .. Alright . .. Gender race . .. Let's talk about race , .. in terms of power . ... If I make the statement which I did , .. that there's no fear factor , when it comes to .. the ChicanoLatino community , and there is much more of a fear factor , ... in dealing with the AfricanAmerican community , ... am I not dealing with a racial factor of power ? .. None Yes None . Sure . Why . ... Because it's gonna affect , ... the decision making process , .. the politics , and um , ... the policy . Alright . .. Africa nan In um , .. i nan .. Kinda like in past , .. AfricanAmericans have been more organized , and have ... had more leaders , .. or not more leaders , but who have more leaders who've been known , or something , More recognized . like Martin Luther King , .. That's right . Yeah , more recognized , and , ... Alright . I think that's a fear factor .  That is a part of the fear factor . .. Mhm .  I mean uh , if .. one looks at what , uh , Jesse Jackson is doing , vis a vis .. who . ... The major league ? ... Baseball teams and all that ? .. Football and all that ? .. What's his underlying argument . .. What's his critici . ... That there're not ... sufficient numbers of .. what ? ... Blacks . .. Well he says minorities . .. He's art . He's talks about minorities . But he's really talking about AfricanAmericans . ... In the uh , .. managerial process of , Right . .. of .. professional sports . Exactly . ... Managerial , ... owners , ... managers , et cetera . right ? .. Alright . Have you heard of a Latino say this ? ... Or would a  Jesse Jackson have said that about Latinos ? ... Hm ? ... No . ... Unhunh . We haven't . .. And uh we're gonna get into that , .. in our discussion . .. Alright . So , .. the whole notion of power is very important ... to understand , because , here I am making some statements . Alright ? ... Some generalities that some people would say are not TRUE . I mean how can Doctor Montoya say that Latinos have no , no real power , no fear factor , After all , they have two people that are cabinet members , .. they have supervisor here in Los Angeles , they have city council people in Los Angeles , and yet he's saying that they have no power . .. Well power is relative ... as well . right ? .. It's relative . It's relational . ... Power is relational . ... How can you measure power . ... Power is impossible to measure . ... Alright ? .. In other words , you cannot break power apart into vi nan various ingredients , .. and say , ... A , ... B , ... C , ... D , these are the ingredients of power . .. We can make generalities . ... Position . ... Wealth . ... All these different things that I've talked about . But power is difficult to measure . ... So that , .. we must deal with the whole question of empowerment , ... from also the perspective of potential power versus actual power . ... There is a difference . ... If I am , ... for example , ... the president .. of .. a major labor union , .. or a major corporation . ... the position , .. as president of that entity , ... gives me so much power . ... But yet if I do not know how to utilize , ... that entity in terms of its mobilization , .. for a given objective , .. like a labor union . .. If I have fourteen million people as members , and I don't show any manifestation of power , am I powerful . ... Well , .. it has to be measured by what ... you're trying to do . what the objectives are . ... Example . ... Labor today , is being challenged by perhaps one of the most ... serious ... pieces ... of nan ... not legislation per se , because it's not in a legislative form yet , but , .. a proposed North American Free Trade Agreement , ... that if passed by Congress , .. is going to impact ... three economies . ... Canada , .. US , .. and Mexico . ... Labor , as a sector , ... is going to be the most .. impacted . ... How is labor today ... mobilizing .. its great power . ... Uh not just the AFLCIO and its fourteen million members , but the United Auto Workers , .. and many other or .. labor organizations , .. what are they doing . .. to influence .. public .. policy . ... Combining power . ... Huh ? .. They're combining their power . .. How are they combining their power . .. By al allying with other , .. um , ... unions of workers . Alright , they're they're they're forming coalitions , .. among themselves , they're forming coalitions with who . Environmental groups . right ? ... Cause .. environment supposedly is going to be also negatively impacted . ... especially along the border . ... Alright , .. so there's , .. there's a lot of coalition building . ... But can you say as a historian , ... that labor is doing what they were infamous for doing thirty forty years ago ? .. Taking to the streets ? No . No they've definitely lost power . ... Alright , .. good point . .. They have nan .. He said , .. they have lost power . So your measurement .. of a loss of power is based on what . ... What they can and can't  . Alright . ... Alright . ... You don't see , ... what you've read about . ... right ? .. Right . .. today . .. Alright . .. That's one perception . ... Is the Black community less powerful today , .. in nineteenninetythree , than it was , ... in nineteen ... sixty ... eight . ... with the poor people's march on Washington , .. or nineteensixtythree , ... again , .. on the w uh march .. uh to Washington , ... on Washington , .. when Martin Luther King gave his ... famous speech , I have a dream . .. There were three hundred thousand people . ... at that march in nineteensixtythree . ... Which ... period .. of time , historically speaking , .. was a time where Blacks were manifesting much more power . ... Today , .. or nineteensixtythree , or nineteensixtyeight . ... When . When they m manifest , they're beginning to get more power ? .. When uh , in in comp nan in in None Now ? When do uh , make a comparison nineteenninetythree , nineteensixtyeight , .. nineteensixtythree , ... during those three periods , .. when , .. would you say , .. Blacks .. demonstrated .. much more power . ... Now ? ... They have more power now . ... They have more power ? .. Why do you say that . ... Cause they're more recognized . ... I mean , ... Does recognition give you power ? ... Hm ? ... Yeah . ... To a nan .. To some ... aspects , yeah . ... I think , .. I think the nan the problem with your question is , s a different sort of powers . ... Ah . Very good . .. Explain that . ... You have uh , ... you have AfricanAmericans more institutionalized , .. in our system now , Ah . .. than they were in sixtyeight . Alright . Stop right there . ... Today , ... they have how many Congresen ? ... Thirty .. eight . ... Thirty ... eight ... congressional representatives . ... I don't know how many they had in nineteensixtythree , I'm not even gonna try to guess , but uh probably no more than two or three if they were lucky . ... Alright . ... Would you say that ? .. I would say that's right . Alright . ... Go on . ... What else . ... In sixtyeight , ... the Blacks were a whole lot more .. mobile . .. mobilized ... Much better mobilized , .. threehundredthousand marching on Washington , .. is an example . ... You probably couldn't get that today . Okay . ... Alright . ... You know withChicanos , the highpoint of the mobilization capability was nineteenseventy . .. During the era of the Vietnam War . .. Twentyfivethousand Chicanos were mobilized in Los Angeles , ... a at the national Chicano moratorium .. against the war . ... No one . ... has come even close . ... With the exception of the death of Cesar Chavez recently , where there were approximately fortythousand people , ... to mobilize . ... large numbers .. of people , into some kind of a ... effort or movement . ... Alright . ... So he's correct . ... It depends .. on the time , .. depends on the circumstances , and the form of power . Institutionalized power is different from , ... the unconventional form that uh y you just described . Alright . .. Well what we're trying to get at , .. is potential .. versus .. actual . ... My argument , ... as humble as it is , ... is that .. Chicanos , ... in nineteenninetythree , .. are fast developing , ... a high .. potential for power , ... but they're a long way from actualizing .. their TRUE power . ... Okay ? In other words , they're we're still at the ... potential phase of our empowerment , .. and not at the actual power phase . ... Alright . .. Anything else ? .. On those two concepts ? .. Alright . ... Let's get into .. discussion on voter participation , and these are kind of general comments , ... I don't have the time to give you a lot of statistics , ... but I'll give you some , ... general uh .. trends , .. some statistical information , that will prove a point , that will introduce the subject ... of .. political participation in the United States . ... Now , a democracy , ... the participation of the citizenry is imperative . ... It is ... absolutely imperative ... if it's to be a democracy , to have the people participate . Now what am I trying to say . ... What am I trying to say . ... It is .. imperative for the people to participate , ... in the political process . .. Another way of saying it . .. What am I saying . ... We have to vote , ... everyone , ... But why is it important , ... in a democracy for the people to participate . ... Just deal with the question . ... Not the methods , .. You mean because .. if ... the people don't vote , .. it will be , ... there will be an elite group , it'll be .. more of a .. monarchy , ... that has control , ... it won't be a democracy . Okay , what's a monarchy . ... Kings , One ruler , ... Well one nan Royalty . ... What ? One ruler , Royalty , ... or one family .  .. Alright . ... Close . ... There's a royal .. type of family right , ... king , Yeah . ... not elected , .. alright , ... hereditary , et cetera et cetera , .. alright . ... But what am I getting at . ... W what's the essence of what I'm asking for ? ... Yes . .. Fire away . ... By ... its very nature , .. democracy demands ... voting . Without voting  nan Ah . .. Stop right there . .. You made a statement . By the very nature of democracy . .. What is a democracy . ... Democracy is rule by the people . ... Alright . .. Demos ... cratos . right ? ... People ... rule .  ? Another Greek word . .. The Greeks were .. major contributors to this political process of development , .. of concepts . Demos ... cratos . People ... govern , or people rule . .. Alright . ... We tell the world , ... that democracy ... is what .. we practice . Is that correct ? .. Is that what we tell the world ? ... Yeah . Yes ? .. Alright . Would you agree with that ? .. Okay . .. What else do we say , selling ... our political system . ... In selling our political system , ... we make it synonymous , ... synonymous .. by saying that , .. we don't distinguish , ... the form of economic system , ... versus the political system , and that we put it in the same kettle . .. Democracy , ... and capitali , ... are essentially the same . ... Are they the same . ... No . .. No . ... But yet we do . .. And , .. if we .. listen carefully , .. and read carefully , ... all these books on international relations , ... foreign relations and so forth , ... what is it that we tell the world , .. that America is . ... The cradle .. of democracy . ... We are the cradle of democracy , we are the bastion of the free world , ... et cetera et cetera et cetera . .. And when Ronald Reagan was in power , ... we talked about the evil empire . right ? .. Categorizing , ... uh , the Soviet Union , ... and the socalled Communist empire , as a evil empire . ... Alright . ... I say this because , .. there is , .. a tendency for some of us to believe , because , .. we have been conditioned . right ? ... Who conditions us to think the way we think . .. What did we deci nan .. What did we say . .. earlier . ... talking about culture . ... Um , .. they learn through .. schools , .. through their families . Schools . right ? ... Schools . ... The media . .. Everything else . .. .. I mean , .. doesn't the media tell us that there's only a twoparty system in this country ? .. Mhm . .. Mhm . Why is it .. that the Communist Party , the Socialist Workers Party , the Prohibitionist Party , the American Independent Party , ... all these parties that we have , ... supposedly minority parties , ... don't get the same kind of treatment , ... as the Democratic and Republican parties . ... They're not mainstream . right ? ... We have a two-party system . We are taught from the very beginning that there's only two parties . .. That's a l- different subject . .. But I'm -- .. What I'm -- The point I'm trying to make is that , .. if we look ... into the realities , .. of what we have as a political system , ... we tell the world , that in this country democracy is very much alive , because we have , a congress , we have , a supreme court , .. we have a presidency , we have a political system , that is , ... governed by certain principles , .. and laws , that emanate from what . ... The Constitution . ... which is a living document . The Constitution . right ? That is very much the document that protects , conceptually and otherwise , ... our way of life . .. Our democracy and so forth . ... Well , ... if we remember .. our Chicano history , ... my point , as we get into the whole question of Chicano political participation , is that , ... it's difficult , .. for us as Chicanos , .. as we get into it , ... to understand , ... why is it , .. including ourselves , .. because a lot of Chicanos don't even understand why we don't vote , .. why don't we participate , .. and they come up with all kinds of somewhat superficial analysis , ... that , .. much of our political behavior , ... is a product of what ... was covered in this class , .. under history , and culture , and what did I say . ... Two . ... major currents , ... of history , ... two .. major currents of political culture , ... right ? And what is political culture . ... I'll get back to that concept . But just .. general terms . .. What is political culture . ... What is political culture . ... Alright . .. I want you to think -- Put that concept down , .. because you're gonna -- you're gonna hear about it in the next few minutes . .. It's very important that you understand that concept . Political culture . But I want -- .. Thing I want to underline here , .. is that , .. we are products , of a historical , ... dualistic process , ... Mexico's history , US history , we're a pr- -- we're products of what ? ... A cultural process , that's also Mexican , ... and American . ... Whatever American means . Alright ? ... So those two major .. ingredients , have molded , the rationale , ... that I'm using in this class , .. to explain , ... why is it , ... that we're still , ... at the potential phase of empowerment , ... and we still , ... have a long ways to go , ... before we realize , .. that concept that I describe , ... called empowerment . ... But before we get into that s- .. substance of that , is that , ... I wanna just briefly cover , ... that , ... even though , .. I'm saying that , ... Chicanos do not vote in great numbers . ... And we don't participate in many organizations in great numbers . The fact is , ... as I mentioned earlier , ... that even though we tell the world , .. we are this beacon of light , ... of freedom , ... of liberty , .. justice , and all these different things , by and large , ... not ... a lot of people .. participate .. politically .. across the board . ... I don't care if you're AfricanAmerican , ... I don't care if you're AsianAmerican , ... and I don't care if you're Latino , or whatever . ... Most Americans , ... do not vote , ... in great numbers . ... So , .. it's a double whammy . ... Introducing the subject matter here . ... Americans , in comparison to Great Britain , .. in comparison to France , in comparison to Germany , .. in comparison to Italy , ... we don't vote , .. in the numbers that they do . ... Alright ? .. I mean , if we had more time , I could give you statistic after statistic , Italy for example , has ... a voter .. turnout , ... of ninety percent . ... Of those that are eligible to vote . ... we're lucky if we get fifty percent . ... Are we .. less democratic ? ... Are they more democratic ? ... Why is it that Italy has , a much larger , .. a higher voter .. level of participation . ... Or Germany . ... Or even Canada . .. Seventy percent . ... The fact is , that democracy in this country ... is dying . ... I want you to put that down . ... Cause it's gonna be important . ... At least for my analysis . I don't want you to agree , or disagree at this point , just write it down , .. you have plenty of time . .. One week to think about it . ... American democracy is dying . ... I want you to put that ... whole .. phrase .. in black and white . American democracy is dying , ... and I want you to try to think .. of why . .. As we get into the discussion .. of Chicano ... participation . ... And we'll get back to that statement .. next week . ... So , ... for us , as Chicanos it's a double jeopardy . ... That's another point I wanna underscore . ... Because if the .. larger general population doesn't vote in great numbers , when you're at the bottom of a political socioeconomic totem pole , and you're at the bottom , ... you're at the very bottom , ... with all the problems of poverty , and all the social problems that we're -- we've been talking about , ... it's understandable why , ... perhaps , ... Chicanos do not vote , .. or participate in great numbers . ... Now , .. the literature , .. in political science , ... dealing with , ... factors influence- -- ... influencing voting , ... are many . ... Are many . ... Civic Culture , ... Almond and Verba , ... nineteen-seventy-two or so , ... is one book that you can look at , ... um , ... there's a book by .. Raymond Wolfinger , ... Steven ... Ronsteen- .. Ronstone I'm sorry , Who Votes , ... that's another book , ... Okay , ... the literature goes on and on . ... But all I want to do , in terms of just giving you .. some idea . ... of what are the factors that influence , peoples' participation in the political process of this country . And there are essentially five . .. You can .. probably develop more , but , .. these are general categories . ... Most of the literature in political science , ... and I think Mister Verba would agree with me on this , that , ... people tend to vote because they have a sense of duty . ... What does that mean . .. A sense of duty . ... They regard participation as important . ... Now , ... why would you say , .. that this .. is a factor that influences voting . ... Now this is a very somewhat altruistic , ... uh value . right ? ... A sense of .. duty ? ... Why . ... Why would you say , ... that people in this country have a -- .. Some people that vote , (COUGH) (COUGH) .. vote because they have a sense .. of .. duty . ... Why . ... Right here . ... I don't know , .. probably it stems mostly from , ... your education , your childhood , when your told , ... you're an American citizen , and it's your civic duty , .. you know , towards other people and , you know , getting the government going , .. to vote , and , put your two cents in . ... Because without you , .. then y- we won't have government . ... Same sense of jury duty , too . .. Jury -- Okay . ... Good point . duty . .. As we go through some of these , ... these five , ... I want you to think of the agents of socialization . ... Because then I want you to think , when we get into the discussion on Chicanos , ... how do those agents affect .. us as Chicanos . Alright , ... number one , sense of duty , ... Who is responsible for inculcating ... that sense of duty . ... One , ... the family . ... Alright ? .. Remember . .. The family is your primary agent . .. Two , ... the educational institutions . ... I mean , from the time that you start .. kindergarten , to the time that you .. graduate from the university , it's constant , .. not constant , .. but somewhat of a consistent .. bombardment .. of values , .. attitudes , et cetera , ... reinforcing the nature of the political system , ... and the virtues .. of ... participating in the political process . ... So in essence , what I'm saying is , you acquire this through the socialization process . that we've discussed already . ... Yes ? ... I think that it's more ... eyeopening , .. to see , .. that , .. this doesn't exist , ... more than it does . .. And that's why people don't vote . It seems that , .. I mean you talk to people , they have an attitude , .. I can't make a difference . ... That's why I don't vote . .. It's not ... my .. responsibility . That's why I don't vote . ... There's not a sense of duty . .. Even though , ... like you said , ... from the beginning , ... supposedly we're getting it .. all through school . Why do you suppose that has changed . ...

They've paid , they've reduced , ... no problem . ... He's handled his line of credit as agreed , so it's .. pretty routine . ... Joe ? ... Okay . ... First ... loan request I have , is an existing real estate mortgage , that .. will be ... refinanced into the secondary market of Fannie Mae . .. Customer is Gerry and Pamela Tucker , .. at sixty-one fifty-eight Main Street , in Hillsdale Illinois , they're requesting eighty-four thousand dollars , on a thirty-year Fannie Mae fixed rate loan , ... this would include the cost of doing the refinance appraisal , .. title work , .. and points . .. Eightyfour ?  ... Eighty four even . .. .. Their monthly payment of principle interest taxes and insurance , would be seven sixty-one eightynine , .. based at the current thirty-year rate . .. .. They estimate the value of their home to be , one-hundred and ten .. thousand dollars . .. .. We had an appraisal in nineteen ninetyone , by a certified appraiser , .. that indicates the value of the house was a hundred and three thousand dollars . Eighty percent of that would make it .. eighty-two four . So , .. um , ... in order to make them a loan for eighty-four thousand , it must appraise for a hundred and five . So that will be , will determine whether or not we can go the full eightyfour , .. and whether they have to come up with some money out of pocket . ... Their assets total one sixteen four seventeen , .. their liabilities eighty .. three , .. .. their .. net worth .. thirtyone . .. So all they owe is the house ?  Mhm . .. They um , ...  T T T . currently have a debt to income of twenty-eight over twentyseven , .. and after the refinance , they would have a ... debt to income of fifteen over twentythree . ...   Where are they now , .. I missed that . ... They're fifteen over -- ... No . .. They're currently .. twenty nan ... They can't be . nan over twentyseven . I- -- ... Oh , okay . ... Twenty . Yeah . ... Twenty over twentyseven . Yeah . You can't even -- Twenty over tw- --  . You can't even read your writing . I couldn't even read my f- -- my own writing .   It's twenty over twentyseven ,  Okay .  And after the refi it's fifteen over twentythree . ... What is acceptable pretty much , uh , .. what figures .   Twenty-eight over thirty-six is the maxes . It's as high as it could go ? See , 3.. so they're well within , 3.. Okay . 3.. I just wondered . 3.. They're well within their 3.. debt to income . I  always heard the figures , and never did know what was high , and , Right . low don't make any difference . Yeah . Um , So you said they're gonna be .. fifteen ? .. Mhm . .. Fifteen over twenty-three so , their debt to income isn't a problem , .. the , uh , .. problem as I see it is , .. the value of the house , number one , .. and the second matter at hand is , that , .. in nineteen eightyseven , .. they had filed a chapter eleven . They had at the time a mortgage with us , They reaffirmed on that mortgage , .. They were never late , .. We , uh , ... After that .. discharge , we even advanced them money to purchase this house , on Main st- Street here in Hillsdale , and um , ... they have never missed a payment on that loan , .. I've also made them car loans , that they've never missed a payment on , and um , according to Fannie Mae guidelines , as long as they have been discharged , .. at least two years , and ... reestablished and paid as agreed , their credit obligations , they would qualify for a Fannie Mae mortgage . ... With that in mind , .. um , ... I am moving , that they app- -- .. uh , that we approve this loan request , subject to a uh .. certified appraisal of their home . ... Do we have the discharge ? .. Yes . .. I have a copy of it . Mhm . When was it . .. It was discharged on , ... November , ... uh no . ... Two twenty-three eightyeight . ... Discharge date was two twenty-three of eightyeight . .. When did they file . Didn't you say they filed in eightyseven ? Eleven of eightyseven . ... In eleven ? ... Mhm . ... Three months ? Whew . ... That's pretty fast . Yeah . What did they do .  Diiss it ? It was a business -- .. No , it was a business , uh , bankruptcy , and , it was pretty cut and dried , they just were eliminating the business , um , .. debt , and apparently nobody objected to the , .. the bankruptcy . ... Since they reaffirmed with their secured creditors . All the debt that was .. charged- -- that was bank- .. filed bankruptcy against was unsecured creditors . ... And they discharged em , before they even performed , or anything ? ... Yeah , in a three mon- -- I guess so , in a p- three-month period of time , cause here's the , ... No I -- ... I just , .. it's unusual that they don't require em to -- you know , usually they put em on a two-year or three-year plan or something , Mhm , ... See , the- from what I I gathered is the , .. unsecured creditors got nothing , .. and the secured creditors , .. just carried on their payment history as agreed . ... As originally set forth in their contracts . ... But you know usually the plan'll provide some period of time of protection . Oh I -- Yeah . .. Mhm . But if we've got uh -- for those unsecured creditors . .. Yeah . .. But if we've got the .. discharge , ... Yeah . Okay . ... Well , in that case , That's hard to believe , because it says that , ... notice of joint -- .. discharge of joint debtors , it -- .. it appears the persons named above , filed a petition , commencing nan ... Yeah ? nan ... joint .. case under title eleven , mhm . .. on November twentythird , of nineteen eightyseven ? ... And that an order of relief has been entered , ... no complaint objecting to the discharge of the debtors was filed , within the time fixed by the court  , Yeah , Yeah .  Uh , what was that . .. Ten minutes ? Or --   Yeah . And um , Yeah . See I don't know how they got it done that fast . and , and that they're um , Hell we can't even get to court in three months . I know .  Hm . (SNIFF) That's ridiculous . That --  I have a lean -- And it's dated February twentythird ,  nineteen eightyeight . Mhm .  ... Okay . That's uh , I mean , three months . That's all -- I just -- .. Yeah . That's what I was just -- .. I assumed it would've been , like eighty -- uh ninety-two or something , Mhm . you know , Yeah . 2.. What -- the five -- .. What actually happened to them , .. was , ... she opened ... a franchise . ... And it was , ... a franchise of doing packaging , sending m , uh , from a mall .. basis , Unhunh ?  uh , packaging , ... gift wrapping , ... and shipping . shipping it . (COUGH) Well , what happened , (COUGH) .. They should have gotten into the business , hindsight's twenty twenty , They should've gotten into the business in let's say August , and then they would've had a Christmas season . There was a t- -- .. It got to be real complicated , and they didn't get in until February . ... Well February they had nothing to do and , .. and I think they , Yeah . They hung in there for .. a year .. and a half . .. And they just couldn't -- .. couldn't see end to it .  -- February nobody's shipping anything . ..  I'll s- -- 2.. I'll second then Joe .  Okay . ... So it's moved and seconded .. to uh , ... approve that loan subject to the , .. uh , .. appraisal by a certified appraisal . ... And the max is eightyfour ? ... Mhm . .. Okay . ... Okay . ... All in favor aye . ... Aye . Aye . Aye . .. Opposed same sign . .. Motion carries . ... ... Is that the only one ? .. That's the only loan I have . Okay . ... I got one all one . ... The only reason it's in here , ... is because the borrowers already have , ... three-hundred three thousand borrowed , so it has to be approved by the board , ... but if we , if Jim and ... Kurt approve it today , that'd be two , and then I'll have to call two more . ... Uh , .. they wanna borrow forty f- -- Well , ... Dave wants to borrow forty-five hundred dollars to , ... finish paying off .. the renovation , .. and upgrade necessary on the ... daycare . ... And , ... he had ... initially thought what he borrowed would do it , and then he borrowed some money from his uncle , and he wants to repay his uncle and get that out of the way . He wants to set it up on a year , ... uh , it would be secured via three vehicles , ... um , .. you know his debt to income is relatively high , but his income's going up , .. the daycare is scheduled to open ... a week after the fifth . ... So around the twelfth to fifteenth of January , ... he thought he's been  -- he thought he was already opened , and then they came back in and told him he couldn't open . .. Cause there was articles in the paper , and they showed kids at the daycare and , .. he had his ads out and everything , but he didn't have all the i's dotted and t's crossed , and state came back in and said , well , no , you can't really do that . ... So , one group of state people , the people that do all the -- ... do the testing for , .. electrical and safety and stuff have been there , and now the state inspector's got to come in , I guess they just .. look at .. the quality of the facility . .. Not necessarily the wiring plumbing and heating , but , is it clean , and is it safe , and that sort of thing . .. They're supposed to be there the fifth , .. and he said , that the lady told him , that it usually takes ... a week , ... for them to send a report in , and .. for their license to come back . ... So , ... he anticipates that they'll be open no later than the twelfth to fifteenth , he gave me some numbers , I can't remember , they've got like , thirteen or fourteen kids they're already taking care of , .. mostly out of their house , until they can get em moved down there , and then they've got eight or nine more . So they fully expect income .. to exceed the projection , .. but right now they don't have any income , other than from .. his job . So , uh , ...  That's fairly large scale . ... What -- .. And he's gonna have twenty people ,   The building is -- or something ? Yeah . ... At l east twenty 5.. children . Yeah . Twenty-five -- See they're e- -- Yeah . They're expecting that many fairly quickly . And then , he hopes to get up .. around fifty . ... See they're looking at four people , plus , ... I've gone through the building , you know , plus his wife . .. and it is uh , ... a r- very .. very nicely done .. operation . I mean there's nothing .. shoddy about the workmanship , or the quality of the material , or the cleanliness of the , .. of the building .  Is it attached onto a storage facility ? No . It's a separate building . Oh it's free-standing building . Yeah . Separate building . See it's a , They -- It's a building his dad had , .. where he was -- .. where he had his nan .. his cabinet shop . Okay . nan shop , and , Okay . .. And was living in it , and they converted the living quarters and all that into this thing . It's like anything , when you're dealing with th- -- ... you know , regulators and the state , .. they , you know , he said they got two ladies for nine counties , and they -- .. There's a lot of this going on , and they can only get to so many . So , I would move , ... since it's secured for forty-five hundred , it's on a twelve-month repayment , which is relatively short , I would move that we ... advance the funds . .. I'll second it . ... Except , ... they owe pretty much , don't they ? .. Three-hundred three thousand , ... and some odd dollars . ... But he's always serviced , .. I mean , he's never been late , he's always paid as agreed , uh , ... and they do have ... the income , it just , right now , the income doesn't -- ... Well , ... I say they have it . Once the daycare gets up to twenty people , they'll have enough income to , Mhm . They'll fall back under the forty percent , But right now they're over the forty , because we st- can't show any income from the daycare . ... Um , ... but , ... you know , it it -- ... you know , I feel comfortable that it's there , and like I say , he's always serviced debt as agreed , and , ... and his overall debt .. is working down , it's just quite a bit of debt . You just , I guess you can't say too much if they're paying on time . Uh uh , ... Yeah . .. and , .. And I think they're about to the point -- as long as everything works out good ,  Yeah , I think if th- -- you know , th- th- -- ... He's already talking , if this thing goes like they think it is , next fall he's wanting to , ... start looking at expanding that .. storage facility . It's one of those things , I think there's -- .. they're always gonna have .. quite a bit of debt , so long as cash flow'll keep up with it . .. Cause , you know he's -- .. that's kind of their , you know he's looking at that as his retirement income , and an investment , and this whole bit , you know , like some of the people do here . ... Well it's been moved and seconded , .. um , .. to approve , but ... that , ... we can't really disburse on that . ... That , .. due to his size , .. of the loan , until we have all -- They need f- 3.. f- -- all the board members ? majority of board member . Yeah . Four -- .. uh f- -- At least two more board members , because I'm voting , Yeah . .. all in -- .. I'm voting .. in favor of it , In favor , and , .. Yeah . .. See I was -- since you seconded it , I assume so are you . Yeah . Yeah . So see I've got two -- and then I'll try to , I'll get hold of two more . I was gonna see Wilbur , but he didn't -- s- .. Dave didn't get in here until , .. after he was gone , .. so , ... that's the only one I have . ... Any other loans . ... No other loans to be discussed . ... I got a .. couple things here , but uh , ... we'll um , ... the one , ... is in regard to , ... the retail , ... nondeposit investment , just to kind of bring us up to speed , .. m- .. Matt has tentatively accepted our ... offer for employment , ... but since he's going to be a dual employee , ... th- -- you really don't need to put this in the minutes .  -- Hm . .. Okay . I'll I'll c- -- I'll catch up .. the board up to speed , I just want us to know , because it has some loan relevance . .. Uh he was interviewed by LCL , Larry Harb interviewed him over the telephone yesterday , and , .. Larry called me this morning , ... that's who had called about seventhirty , and said everything went fine . Um , ... what -- .. what we have set up is , Matt's going up to Chicago , at LCL's office , .. on uh , ... for .. Monday evening , ... Tuesday , and Wednesday training . .. The f- -- The Monday evening and Tuesday training , will be very specific for him , their workflow , their forms , he'll get to meet these people . On Wednesday then , he'll be in a little bit of a larger group , ... there may be four or five other asset managers with him , discussing sails .. motivations and , and .. and sales approaches and strategies , ... ... Larry said , Ph- he doesn't know how Matt's gonna plug into us , ... philosophically , and how well he's known in the area . ... He said that's our decision . .. Of which , .. I- you know , I'm comfortable with . ... I wanted Larry to tell me how he thinks he's gonna do , plugging into the selling , and he said oh , you -- he should be -- he should do very well . ... So I- I'm , um , tho- -- .. that looks good . ... What I did , .. kind of , .. in regard to that , was , ... and , .. I don't have this date finalized , but , s- -- .. I'm trying to go maybe the second week .. of .. January , to have ... a representative of Bankers Systems , .. come THUMP here THUMP . ... to do some specialized training , ... within the qualified retirement plan ... area . ... Matt needs , .. Matt .. needs an understanding of , ... not a detailed understanding , but how all these qualified plans work , ... so that he w- ... can have , ... so he understands how , his products plug into the to the self-directed IRAs , SEPs , and the like . We also , .. it would do us .. good to know what products we can offer , under those qualified retirement plans . So , .. uh R- -- Ray Galino I I believe is his name is , supposed to come down , ... I haven't set up a date , ... but , ... he'll be here .. on a f- -- for a day , and I wanted him to talk with Matt , Vivian , myself , .. and , .. sometime during the day to the two of you . Because as loan officers , you have a good handle on .. borrowers and , ... and can kind of tell them of these SEPs , and some of the other products . Uh , we've kind of hesitated in .. in offering those ,  .. well , we have not offered the selfdirected . Hm .  Offering the self-directed we're getting , is simply , we need to get a dif- -- fifty different forms . .. Instead of called an IRA , ... it's called an IRA SD , .. for selfdirected . .. And then , .. that will allow people , to , .. if they don't want .. all their funds in .. a bank CD , as .. as are custodial IRA arrangements . See , the existing IRA says , all those funds have to be in First National Bank of Hillsdale . The selfdirected , ... the .. the participant signs a an investment ... direction , ... or , ... where where ... he directs ... the investments . ... They sign the form , and then you invest in whatever they want to . Yeah .   . Uh , ... the , .. what . How that works like with the SEPs , ... the SEP ... has a vehicle , .. has to be connected to the IRA . ... So we take the SEP off the shelf , ... and then if the person .. wants that money put into a bank CD , then we just use our custodial .. IRA forms . .. If .. they want a self-directed i ... SEP , you take the same .. SEP form off , but you're using a different .. IRA . ... You're not using the custodial IRA arrangement , Oh , okay . An SEP must have an IRA attached to it . .. So that- -- So , the IRAs all fit in the same .. plan . .. They're just different ... ch- boxes checked off of this overall ... plan . And that , .. the overall plan is what you're talking about goes back , that's what the IRS has blessed . Right . They -- is the framework , and so long as you stay within the framework in some combination , you're okay . ... Exactly . So , .. I .. I had talked with .. with Rick uh Brady today ,  and , ... he's gonna send me those forms , so we can take a look at em , .. The other -- The thing which makes it a little more complicated , but it's really not a cost , ... it's kind of a s- .. flipflop , in that , he recommended we don't try and do the account maintenance on those self-directed IRAs ourselves . .. Because of how complicated the law is in all this , Mhm . so , Mhm .  .. I mean , ... coincidentally Banker Systems offers a comprehensive account  maintainance services ,  You're kidding . Isn't that  --  Well , isn't that a surprise ?  6..  That- that's such a surprise . Yeah .  ..  ..   And , .. what- what- what we would do is , .. they would take care of the account maintainance .  In a similar manner , if you will , as ... they take care of the , .. the other qualified plans . .. Mhm . .. We- -- They- -- ... We send them the information , th- -- But they print it , and , They -- They crank out the numbers . qualify it , and , And , .. and they file whatever needs to be filed . disclose it , Mhm .  The -- ... It's really not gonna cost us , it it's gonna be pretty much of a swap . Right now , we use their eight-hundred number , ... and .. their , .. uh , ... fi- -- .. their newsletter . ... for the IRAs . .. We don't have their comprehensive service , we have their IRA service . And that runs about three-hundred dollars a year . ... If you go to the comprehensive account maintenance , ... the eight-hundred number is included , and the f- -- and the newsletter is included . .. So we would drop three-hundred dollars off . The account maintenance , ... comprehensive account maintenance , ... maintenance would cost us five-hundred dollars . But , ... what you do is , .. they- -- ... he estimates it'd be five-hundred dollars , for a minimal number of accounts , Banker System charges thirty-five dollars ... an account . ... And he said under a self-directed arrangement , ... he's seen ... charges , .. to maintain a self-directed IRA , .. anywhere from forty to a hundred fifty dollars . Now I think a hundred fifty dollars is a lot , to maintain a self-directed IRA . Mhm . .. So you mean , None -- .. that you -- we could pass that back to the customer ? .. That's what you're saying , Right . Right .  We -- They charge us five-hundred plus thirty-five per account ? .. Well he- he thought -- he's gonna send me down the information , you know how the typical salean , they , they they d talk in kind of nebulous terms , Yeah . but he thought , Okay . w- they -- .. they have a minimum number .. of accounts , ... nan .. Oh , with w- -- .. is covered if you will by the fivehundred .  Yes . .. Okay . And so he said , .. way I understood it would , ... let's say five-hundred would would cover the eighthundred , .. which is very very helpful service , Mhm .  and uh , ... the .. maintenance for let's say twenty accounts . ... Well , .. if we had .. ten accounts , Okay . .. we would charge .. five-hundred fifty dollars on ac- on an account , it would be five-hundred dollars , it's really kind of a switch around but , what .. what that would -- .. I think it would be good for .. the five or six of us , to , ... to have Galino down here , can kind of explain what products , ... we can offer from the bank side , ... Hm . Matt needs to know that , and .. and we all need to know that , and then , ... we can figure out how Matt's , ... the products that LCL's gonna offer will plug into that . ... And it's -- ... I was thinking of sending Matt up there for a week , but , ... you know he's up there a week , he's gonna learn a lot of very technical .. information , such as like those section four-fifteen XSes . .. That .. that I was talking about . You really don't need to know the the technical . nitty-gritty ... about it , .. because , ... that's what Bankers Systems does . They take care of the nittygritty , Hm . So , it's gonna be less expensive , .. to have ... Galino come here , ... instead of one person going up to .. to Minnesota for a week , ... and then trying to bring back the information , ... we're gonna have Galino come down here for a day , ... and , he won't -- .. he won't touch any specific .. complicated .. items . .. Such as four-fifteen XSes or , or ACP testing or that . ... Cause Vivian and I kind of know that , but if we don't know that , like that four-fifteen .. uh XS , Mhm . I called the eight-hundred number , and .. and they went through the explanation , where the IRS changed ... the the deduction . ... Just a -- ... Just a ... question . ... from a mechanics . Who's gonna hold the account . .. Is LCL ... gonna hold the account , is the bank gonna ... ho- ... hold the account , .. Who act- -- .. You know , you're talking about bank products , and .. and LCL products , like before , the trust department , if you will , held the account . .. That that's physically where it was , Mhm . you know , Is is it's -- .. I nan .. is the plan .. gonna be in the bank , or will the plan be in LCL , or is the plan just kind of nebulous , ... Well -- .. well the .. the SEP and the IRA , will- will be First National Bank of Hillsdale . ... Okay . .. That's what I meant . But .. but tho- those -- They're bank products . ... if you will . .. We offer those , and then LCL , if .. will have , ... within that plan , they'll have things you can buy , if you want to direct it that way . ... If you don't want a CD , Tha- the- -- or if you want something else , you could direct that , that the monies be used to buy ... some mutual fund , or some bond fund or something . Right . And how I envision that then , Okay . we would get ... the .. statement .. from LCL , .. for the .. mutual fund holdings , let's say the person also had a CD . Okay . Mhm , Let's -- .. You know , it doesn't matter how they split it . Like we do now . And then .. then , ... what what we would have to do is , .. pull that information together . We would get LCL's statement , ... as of .. the end of the year . What the income was , and what the balance was , we would then have to , if they had a CD , pull that in , we would report that up to Bankers Systems , Okay .  and they would then combine that , .. and produce the report . It -- .. That's why there's .. normally a cost in those selfdirected , because , ... it's not , .. with our CDs now , that information , .. that's the whole account , .. and whatever's out there on the .. on the retire , on the RAP record , just passes right up , ... and .. and the CD and the RAP information , r- retirement account ... processing system talk together . Mhm . When you get another vendor in here , like LCL , we physically have to put the papers together . But it's not that complicated . But the name of his office is gonna be LCL . S- -- It's not gonna be First National Bank , Right . .. Right . Anything .  The- the -- ... I got a f- -- Oh . Yeah , .. I love ... expansions of business . It took me forty-five minutes to get a phone number .   ... The phone number by the way is , For LCL . 2.. Yeah . POUND five five five , ... five five .. five five POUND . ... Is what the phone number will be . .. But , .. this is .. things that , I'm I'm .. anxious for Matt to get here , because I'm getting , .. I'm getting tuckered out , trying to .. get all these nitty-gritty things ,  It's not tough to get the phone number . But see they need the phone number in order to order letterhead , Mhm .  in order to or- .. have business cards . .. LCL in 2.. in Chicago needs that , Mhm . .. to get that process going . Hm . Uh ,   Uh is there LCL accounts gonna be maintained here , cause cause actually -- I mean , or .. is there gonna be a separate , They're gonna have an account in Chicago , for the funds to pass through ? Or is it gonna be passthrough funds here at the bank ? Or , is that nan -- ... Well , .. w- .. what we'll do is , ... those'll probably wire transfer out . Through Boltmans or something , Well , .. through the Fed , what -- I think what will happen , but we -- .. Matt'll find this out , and , I mean , we'll get involved in it , and I'm -- I'm not -- ... whichever way it goes is fine , but probably the most sophisticated way , will be , everyone who makes -- ... who buys a fund , or whatever , ... that money will go into a .. a clearing account here . ... And then , we will , ... either LCL will .. will ACH it .. out of us ,   .. Or , ... we'll physically wire it up there . ... You know None , there may be ... a hundred thousand dollars in there , which may represent ... three people's , or four people's .. purchases , Mhm . and then Matt faxes the paperwork up to LCL , ... and they do the suitability testing , ... and then they know ... what products have been bought , ... and then on the other side , .. we do a wire transfer , .. to physically get the money up there . I think that's how it's gonna work . Si- .. similar to Fannie Mae . .. Ex- ex- -- .. Uh yes . Mhm . Sa- same- same- same type of thing . Yeah . We we 3.. we collect monies , Custodial account , we collect monies , and , put it in account , 4.. and then , 4... we tell them how much of it is theirs , 4... and , 4... by calling up there ,  and that dial deal , and then it- .. they zap it the next day . Yeah . .. I don't know if , Okay , .. nan like , .. that's the same way that uh ... American Express with the traveler's checks work . When we sell Traveler's Checks , .. we put that money in a clearing account , and then Jo Anne , or Grace , or Tom , or somebody calls , whosever doing that job , .. calls  a number , Mhm . ... and , .. we report , .. how much .. in sales we had , and they d- -- .. they d- ... hit the account the next day and take the money out . But that's -- that's kind of the .. the mechanics of the .. of the flow of funds . But , to answer your question Joe , is that , LCL , .. that office .. will .. not say First National Bank of Hillsdale , ... or anything of the nature . Anywhere . .. Yeah . Uh , .. the -- .. his his card will be LCL investments , at First National Bank of Hillsdale . Um , ... letterhead will be LCL , ... there needs to be a .. separate phone line , ... POUND going .. to that office POUND . And we'll -- we'll be able , when we get this receptionist set up , the receptionist will also answer it , .. but when they pick up the phone , .. you know we'll put it on a red line , or .. blue line or something like that , when they pick up that line , like we do with with with Bill's number , you know they .. they pick up , and they'll say LCL investments . They also -- and it's also requirements by uh , ... uh I guess NASDAQ or whomever , and the comptroller that , .. they don't .. want us , when that line rings , we're not gonna pick it up and go , hello , First National Bank of Hillsdale , and they go , oh yeah , I wanted to talk about a mutual fund , oh I'm sorry , yeah , you do have LCL in- investments . I mean , these are some of the nitty-gritty things ,  Yeah . They they talk about in the regulation , and I'm pretty confident they'll .. they'll implement those out . But , Is Matt gonna carry on .. his ... other livelihood that he had before , ... through that office ? Or , is he totally out of the insurance business . N , He was meeting with- -- they had a regional meeting , or , meeting with their regional manager today , and he was going to .. to tell him , that , .. he's plans to take a job here . .. C- Common courtesy says , that he .. needs to give em two weeks notice . ... But , .. the- .. the practice within the .. the industry , and Larry -- .. Matt said this , and also Larry Harb said this . So , .. I know it's not .. Matt's employer , it's just within that industry , as soon as a person says , I've decided to move on to another -- another uh .. uh ... customer ,  or an- another .. employer , KNOCK .. ni- -- Come in . Did you need to talk to Genevieve . ... N- I'll g- -- .. see if she's gonna be , at a number where I could talk to her in maybe a half an hour or forty-five minutes , Okay . Or else I'll give her a call tomorrow . Okay . Um , as soon as they get notice , ... they typically say well fine , .. thanks for the two weeks notice , but it's effective today . And then they electronically ... transfer .. his licenses , .. to his- -- .. to to LCL . But , so these slides should be real interesting . ... Yeah . I think it'll be real interesting I think it'll be a real , a good slide show . .. Too bad you can't make it . ... Who else do you know that's been there besides .. what's her name . Just Jessie and Shana , Shana , her , that's all . ... Yeah , Shana's , sort of , .. I wanna go . ...  But- -- I'd like to go also , It's an interesting thing . but , .. Hunh ? .. I'd like to go . .. It's an interesting thing though , because , um , I'm wondering , ... you know , since it is such -- ... m , ... it's restricted , you have to go through Mexico . ... No . I don't think so . Isn't Nicaragua one of the things you -- No . places you can't go ? I don't think so . No , I think it is . we have -- No , I don't think so . We have f- f- -- .. Technically speaking , .. full .. diplomatic relations with Nicaragua , Oh yeah ? Yeah , they have an , an ambassador , and , .. you know an American ambassador there ,  I -- then why does everybody always have to go through Mexico . who --  like a nest of CIA spies . That's just -- there -- there isn't a direct transportation . but there n- -- I thought , it's not , no , but I thought it w- --  it's not like going to Cuba . .. Where they have to make connections through Mexico because , Oh . I knew someone who went to Cuba ,  and had to go , yeah . make connections through Mexico .  That's because it's illegal for Americans to travel to Cuba .   But I wonder whether this -- It is . Yeah . It is .  . Oh yeah . Just like Lebanon just became . ... how long -- They say Lebanon is actually , how long's -- they- -- it d- just became illegal . .. and- and- I- -- you know . ... For a few years , how long has it been illegal . Libya , too . Isn't Libya as well ? There's quite a few pla- -- Libya ,  .. There's only a -- there's only a handful of places . How long has it been illegal for Americans to --   go to Cuba . Well , Since the fif- -- it was illegal , since the fifties , it was illegal , or the sixties . it was illegal , .. you know , from like the .. time of Cath- -- .. the Castro revolution , up until , I think the early seventies , the Supreme Court , overturned .. travel restrictions , on the um , .. on the passport , and said that the government couldn't , .. really , ... permit you from going anywh- -- uh , prevent you from going anywhere , And then , .. tha --  that changed again , a few years later they passed some laws , or something like that , which did enable the government to , .. to do um , .. visa res- .. restrictions , and , I think Cuba , and North Korea , .. Now Lebanon , And now Lebanon , and Libya , ... Unhunh . .. are the only places that uh ... maybe North- -- .. maybe Vietnam also .  where you ,  .. you're , .. supposedly , not able to use your passport to go to . .. but , .. you really . I mean you can , .. They know . you know ,  the thing is , what I'm wondering -- you can , like people go to Cuba all the time , what I'm wondering is , people that go to Nicara- -- and less o- -- less often to Nicar- --  doesn't the State Department ? to North- None None  to Vietnam , and North Korea , Wouldn't the State Department know , everybody that went to Nicaragua . but people go to Cuba all the time . (SNIFF) PSure . Wouldn't they know . And that's what's sort of worrisome .  is b- crawling with the CIA .  That's what's worri- .. worrisome , but that I'm sure , if they -- I'm sure they have Jessie on a list anyway . but , oh , yeah . I mean , but I'm saying , well he's the only existing live member of the Peace and Freedom Party left .  You know , but ,  but he's a -- The only one under the age of sixty  ,    yeah , I know . And it's really funny ,  that I would think that they would have , .. a -- a thing on you , they would actually , .. possibly even keep an eye on you , or , .. or watch you , I don't know how many Americans have been to Nicaragua . Oh , I doubt it  . how many , No , plenty .  There're de- -- there're delegations that- -- a lot have gone , that's TRUE , a lot of people  , a lot of del- -- there's delegations going every week . thousands . Yeah , thousands have gone .    Well there -- a lot of them are religious , so , that is , you know , religious , they d- -- they'd usually , and there , Church things . And lots of people like trade unions , going down to see for themselves . and political , Mhm , you know , left -- .. leftish , Unhunh . or liberal types , ... and um , .. .. but uh , I would love -- .. I would love to go . ... Yeah . ... Yeah ? ... I wanna go too . ... I'd -- I'd rather go to Mexico though . I -- ...   Not quite the same .   I'd kind of like to go to Guatemala . None I wanna go to Mexico None . but ,  I think Mexico's like the place to go , I don't know . because it's got everything . It's got history , it's got big cities , yeah , it's got ruins , and it's got ,  and it's got resorts .  you know , and oh God , God , listen to you  . the- the Caribbean is incredible .  None resorts None . it's just this bl- beautiful , beautiful , blue water , ... What . .. I know .  I know the Caribbean is incredible .  beau- -- 2.. beautiful beautiful blue --  , blue water , and and , warm water , and like .. coral , and tropical fish , and incredible , r- like .. resort , .. like um , .. hotels , and restaurants ,  Oh , when we were there last , we -- th- it was just after an election .  And I got all these great , um , photographs of , .. of like um , posters , and demos . election posters , you know , from all the like little uh , hunger strikes ,   the little , ... various leftish parties , and they'd like , you know , p- post -- then um , .. wall , .. graffiti , and , and posters all over everything , so I took a bunch of pictures of that . and they were , pr- .. currently having um , hunger strikes , all over southern Mexico .  B- um , ... because it was a particularly , I mean it was even --  It was real obvious corrupt election . much -- It was even more c- --  it was even more corrupt than the usual corrupt election . What they did is they stuffed ballots , and ,  Oh yeah , uh , they they always stuff ballots . But this f- .. time , uh , was real obvious . it was even more .. blatant than usual . .. and uh , ... ... so I got all- -- I got pictures of them , having their um , .. their -- eople -- the people doing hunger strikes , and that kind of thing , None I'll .. put a spell on you None .   .. and , in um ,  in particular , in one little .. Indian town ,  ... f- forgot what the town was called . .. Tlacochahuaya . you know , I mean , most of these things we saw like in , in Oaxaca and , .. you know , places that were -- .. that were um , .. pretty big . .. But we went to this one little tiny Indian town , .. and um , .. there they -- you know , in the -- in the little um , ... I forget what they call it . The central . .. the little central plaza area . La plaza . .. Mercado . What . w- y- I forget . There was some term they used for it , Oh yeah . So- -- the the ,  None Zocalo None . None zocalo None . The None zocalo None . The None zocalo None . None Zocalo None . Unhunh .  Um , .. There was a big b- --  None What is this , a big band there , there's a town , and , there is a town right around here , that is -- still has a zocalo . that's built around a zocalo . You were telling me about that . Oh that was right th- -- ..  well None that was Sonoma . Sonoma . still has a zocalo . ... Did you know that ? .. .. It really does . yeah , it was built around a , it -- it's built during the -- ... the Mexican -- ...  the whole town is still built around the vil- uh the plaza actually , probably during the Spanish period , and or , .. during the Mexican period , I don't know and ,  but the whole town still has the old Mexican plaza , and the Mexican governor , .. general's house , .. was right there and , .. and the church , and that's like the main street , and that kind of thing is , None you know . you know , right in the center of Sonoma . .. Sonoma of all places . ... Yeah , so you can go up there and , ... psee old California , and drink wine . .. that's interesting . s- -- um , .. did you ever find out what disease you had ? .. No . .. I've .. went to the doctor , and he- did a blood test ,  I think you ought to change doctors . and said , .. and said , uh , I just went to some local doctor , right here , I didn't go to Deutsch . oh , you didn't go to him  Um , no . He just di- did a blood test , and said , yeah , well , your b- -- your blood's all shot , and you have the liver of a ninetyyearold , um ,  None Do you drink None ? And il- -- and I -- and I think -- and he doesn't drink . and I think , I think uh , you- you picked up some ,  ... v- um , Virus . virus , like , uh , he named like half a dozen viruses , and said , Ah , I could do some more tests , and find out which one , but , by the time we got the test .. results back , you'd probably be over with it anyway , so why bother .   He is like that though . that's his attitude . That wasn't Deutsch . That's what I don't like about him . Oh . .. That wasn't Deutsch ? That sounds like Deutsch , No . that sounds like something he would do . No , it was somebody right here , named Doctor Garcia .  ... Hm . ..   University of ,  pSouth Guadalajara .   hunh .  or uh , Grenada . ... Hey . Grenada  --  What about  -- Grenada University  .  .. Doctors . ... So that's put you off traveling down there ?   Twice in a row , almost deadly diseases , And you both eat the same things ? .. Yeah . Yeah , I just -- In fact , I eat .. stuff that he doesn't eat , I don't know . that , he wouldn't dare touch . you know , I eat like a ceviche , and , and , all kinds of salads , and , Guata .  ... I- I eat all kinds of stuff like that . .. you know ?   The ceviche's full of vegetables ,  .. full of cut up tomatoes , and and . I eat most everything that you do . I don't eat ceviche , Raw fish . Yeah , he does . because I don't like the idea of eating raw food . raw nan  but , yeah , I mean raw m- -- like meat , and fish , and the idea bothers me , but ,  I eat everything else , you know , I eat like , .. you know , .. vegetables , and , s- salads and ,  That's the problem though . m- f- meat from like little corner stands , you're a lot more , you're a lot more delicate --  None cause who wants to go and travel , in None th --  And- -- None yeah . in -- in areas like that , and like , not be able to s- to have the local food . That's part of the whole thing .    It's delicious , It's cheap ,  So I eat the local food , and get deathly ill . .. he's v- real s- -- None real weak system .  -- Now you're -- Now you're not gonna go back . So  , Now I'll never go back . I won't have to worry about it . I won't be put in that position anymore .  That's terrible . Real depressed immune system . Real bad . He gets sick real easily . Yeah . ... all the t- -- all his life he's been like that . it's really horrible . Yeah . .. Would you like a supplement ?

Mm . th- -- I think i- --  I think -- I think her complaint , .. one of her complaint . .. who knows what her complaint -- Oh , the dogs keep me up , and , and , and the d- -- you know , this and that , as opposed to my son , and real stupid stuff None , is on the verge of th- OD'ing and , Mhm ,  Yeah , right right right . Yeah , it's the same thing . It's just a general ,  malaise about life .   you know ,  3 Molestar general 3 . Hm . that , you know , Right ? it never ends . you know ? .. It never ever ends .  ... Look at that . it's  -- Is -- is it the season , for your turtles to be romantically involved ? ... Uh , I guess so . They've been doing it for a while now .   It's really amazing .  I think though it's really neat to watch em . He he ca- -- he he , like , t- uh tw- takes his nails , There he goes again . and he flutters em in front of it , like trying to cast a spell over her . ... Yeah . It's really ama- -- Have you .. read .. why that's done ? ...  -- Yeah , he's trying to cast a spell over her . Oh and that's in the turtle book   ? Is he really ? Well no , I mean it's not literally that ,  that's their , Like hypnotize her . That's their um , That's the little mating  it's their .. mating courtship ... ritual . Dance , And when -- and when she's kinda . when she's interested , He saw them porking . .. you know , I saw em , I saw em actually doing it .  I'm one of the very few living human beings ,    who've seen turtles having sex .    You know . Look , there he goes again , He's trying None -- She doesn't -- ... See , he's wiggling the things in front of her face , halalalalalala . trying to get her interested . ... He's got these real real long fingernails ,  Yeah , the males only have the nails . The real long -- the ma- None -- and fat tails . .. The males have those l- -- Look , watch watch . Watch him flutter and -- .. I love the little fl- -- have you seen it flutter . ... It's really amazing . .. And yet she's not running from him . I remember at the beginning , when he started his courtship thing , she was frantically running around , like trying to get away from him . And he was biting her , Yeah . and stuff like that . Now None ,  .. I don't really know , I mean I haven't -- .. I haven't s- bothered to sit around and catalog , what they're doing , you know but , this I think is fairly light . I think this is -- he's just crying to like , Could be foreplay . check her out . This is -- this is he's checking her out ,  I don't even think it's gotten to the foreplay yet .  Yes it could be  . This is the ,  hey , come'ere babe .  You know ,  And she's kinda , nan k- shining him on ,   .. she's not really , but she's not showing a lot of interest , either . ... I think when he starts biting her , His tail is curved like that . Does it always get curved like that ? Yeah . Yeah , 3.. You know , I don't know .  and sometimes it's straight . Yeah . I think when he starts biting her , that's when he's --  .. Do you know , .. he's a lot more interested , and so is she . that when we bought him , when we bought him , .. he was larger than her . Now look at them . ... She's a glutton . ... he was larger than her . None Remember that ? She's like twice as big as he is now . ... I mean I -- .. I just can't imagine . It's incredible . She's just growing . She's gonna be as big as that turtle in the pet shop . Yeah in thirty years . How big is that . Huge .  I mean , it is .. just -- They've had this thing -- .. th- this turtle for like thirty years . like twenty years . Ever since the pet shore opened up .  The problem is , is it's in a tank this size . and that's kinda sad . Yeah . It does- -- it can't move . It can't swim , it can't do anything . What are you gonna do when it gets this big ? You're gonna have to like , transfer it to a bathtub , ... You're gonna have to have a , Mm . like an old , .. old bathtubs aren't hard , .. aren't hard to find . ah p ,  .. I give her a qu- swift kick into the LA river , at that point . Oh , come now . Ken . Ken , you would not . You kidding me , How could you abandon her about twenty y- -- she alr- -- she already eats me out of house and home . 3 Yes she does  . Oh ,  --  But you know , a few worms  , when she gets that big , .. Oh a few worms , when she gets that big , she'll need a vat of worms . And they're expensive . Well % , you'll provide them . You'll have all your investments ,   You know what -- and , she'll be supporting you , You know  , No , yeah . I'm gonna b- -- What am I gonna -- what is it that I'm gonna be invested . You know what though Ken ,  you said as they get older , they z- -- they eat more vegetable matter . Yeah . So I'll have to b- feed her ,  .. and grapes . I'll have to feed her heads of lettuce . Will the protein 2.. needs go down ? at a time .   or , I guess . No , you know what he's , That's what I've read . he's such a softie , he -- You know what they do eat . .. That he refuses , which would be easy to feed ,  cheap ,  I'm not gonna give them goldfish .  Live , they love to eat , 3:00 they love -- they only eat live food . Sadistic . None I'm not gonna None kgive them --   It's against his his his philosophy of life . I'd love to see it .  I'd love to see him chase and eat up a goldfish , 4 Yeah , a Roman circus in your tank . and they won't 4 let me see it  . I'm not ,  5.. 5 It just , I mean the idea of dropping a little goldfish into there , 6 6 and then like , you know , watching it like .. go- like , It's neat . you know , like pick .. goop off the bottom , and do its little goldfish business , you know , and then all of a sudden have a turtle come over ,  and take a big hunk out of it . You know , and then that gets a little shock  , They won't eat it . the thing is it , you know . the thing it uh will actually be half swimming , and half not . h , And they take bites out of it . well  , you know they take bites . They d- -- it's not a whole thing ,  You know and , and sometimes they can get the whole thing down at once , other times they just like eat the tail , They don't quite make it . and a piece of the fin , and , and then the , you know , the goldfish manages to get away and , .. flutters around the tank trying to get away from him , h . ha- half gone . Oh Ken ,  .. I don't have the heart for that kind of thing . when you say it that way , I don't think I could stand it eith-  --  Well you know what I was doing , is for about two months , when I had that snake in my classroom , .. I would once a week , it would be a whole ritual . Tuesday . The kids knew . .. Tuesday , we would all sit around the rug , we'd put the snake , .. we- we named it Sissy , and we'd put , we'd s- put Sissy , like right in front of all the kids , and I would get- buy a feeder locally , and I would bring it in , .. and I would put it in the little thing , and we would watch the snake , .. hunt , ... you know , we would watch Sissy hunt .. the goldfish . .. And the go- -- and the snake , ... and t was so h --  Your snake was eating goldfish ? .. None Yeah None . Mhm . .. It would l- eat only live things . .. Th- that's the only way they feed . You have to buy em feeder fish . Yeah they won't eat None , some k- --  some kinds of snakes won't eat-- None They'll eat crickets , 2.. (%) 2.. eat dead things . and things like that . Oh yeah , so you put little goldfish down in the box ,  I would put it , and then it would -- But they'd put it in a little , No , No . in a bowl . in like a little cup a little water . and , .. cause it'll only eat it live . And so the snake , The bowl was about yea big , ... you know , and then the snake would start to -- it would see it . .. And it would start to do this whole little dance . It would start circling the bowl , and wrapping itself , and it would get faster and faster . Then it would start s- -- it would start ... moving , .. at the same pace that the snake would b- -- that the fish would be swimming . And it would start , .. kinda following it . And going fast and fast , It would be like this little whirlwind . You know ? And all of a sudden it would go .. chk . .. And you know what's so funny . ... The snake , ... was v- -- th- they're v- -- they're very b- -- th- -- I guess they're very bright about goldfish . Cause it ,  it would rarely get it , .. it would rarely get the fish , it- w- -- by the fin . It would almost always get it by the head , because it was streamlined . Cause it would , it it would get it by the tail , then the fins would all get -- it would be hard to swallow . Do you know what I mean , Mhm . It would get all fluffed out . Right . And um , ... the kids loved it . ... Well , It was their favorite time of the week . They lo- -- and -- except , B little bastards .  I had one little girl . I had one little girl named Ana Mehia . (HICCUP) And she was this sensitive sweet little girl from uh Guatemala . Who was -- Actually her language was great . And every time . You know what she would do ? The first time she did ? .. She- she did -- ... She crossed herself . She did the cross . for the fish . .. For the Fish .  And I asked her , why did you do that , little  fishy . and she goes , so that the fish'll go to heaven . Aw , wasn't that sweet None .  And then , .. from that point- -- and then she cried , .. And then from that point on , .. everybody would be sitting there , looking at the fish anxiously , and I would have to .. tell em to sit down , cause you know , others can't see .  Calm down . calm down .   She , ... would turn around , so she'd be facing the wall , so she couldn't watch . ... Well , a very sensitive little kid . This seven-year kid . And she wouldn't wa . And she was -- t was like , talk about , you know i , not influenced by peer pressure , cause all the kids were excited , and and she knew in a sense , that she was s- kinda supposed to be excited , cause all of the other kids , and she no , ... She was- -- and it's really , really , really interesting . You know ? I wonder what her personal history   .  And , and then we , Yeah . 4 Oh , you know , we drew , I know 44 . .. What was so funny is , you know , we had like language lessons from it . None We wrote about it . You know , and they would do one or two sentences . about it , and a lot of the kids mentioned Ana . And -- Y- -- the snake- -- Sissy s- ate the fish , and Ana cried . ...  That was like their --  a lot of them did those sentences , Great . 4 and it was really fu- -- and then , a lot of them would draw a picture of Ana , you know , they'd -- .. they'd do their sentences , and then they'd draw a picture of Ana .  .. um crying . ... And what did she write . ..  Um , Sissy ate the fish and I cried  ? nan I- -- nan  None --  2  2..  Ki- -- I don't remember what she wrote , but it was something similar like that . It was something like , .. the f- -- the ate the goldfish and stuff , And I wouldn't -- you know , I'd -- I would have it from .. the morning . Cause I would pick it up in the morning , or I'd pick it up the n- -- that's what I'd do , I'd pick it up the night before . Like , if it w- -- if we're feeding it , I would pick it up Monday , .. I would take it home . ... And that was the worst part . I would take it home , .. and I would like put it in , I would leave it in its .. plastic bag , put it in a bunch of water . in the sink . and I wouldn't go near the sink . cause I didn't wanna look at this thing . .. I didn't wanna get friendly with this fish . .. You know , and then I would take it in , I would t- put it in its bag , and I would put it in a .. paper bag . .. And so I wouldn't look at it . .. And I would put it like over by the sink in the classroom , all day , you know , until it was feeding time . And I wouldn't look at it , and I wouldn't let the kids look at it . Only when it was put into the bowl . Cause I just , ... it was , I was the worst . You didn't wanna get -- I was going , ew , ew . You know like th ,  Listen to her , it was really --  f- -- you know , five minutes ago , she said she really wouldlove to see the turtles eat a goldfish ,   None Now she's saying how it was None the worst None .  No no no but ,   5 It was just the idea of it ,  it's interesting . it's neat .  Yeah . it's interesting but , You know , to see it . but but but to actually see it , 2  is , is not .. as uh ,  I remember once ,  when I was a kid , it , rit's really stuck in my mind . (SNIFF) None h , I went , (SNIFF) I used to , l- um , .. go to an elementary school , that had like a p- a pet shop . .. right around the corner from it . And I used to go into the pet stores and look at all the b , the animals ,  Didn't you guys go to the same elementary school ? and the fish and stuff all the time ? Los Feliz . ... Anyway , um , ... (GULP)  None Where was y- el- -- where was the pet , Right around the corner , .. where -- thyou know where the bank is ? the Security Bank ? ..  And there's all those little shops , Unhunh . there's like Tamara's , that sandwich shop , and stuff ?  On Hollywood ? Um , .. Hunh ? No on Vermont . On Hol- -- It was on Vermont . .. On Vermont , .. like w- maybe , six shops up from , from uh .. um , Hollywood , or Prospect . ... rather . Um , there was .. a little pet shop called Pandora's Pets . When I was in elementary school . (SNIFF) Pandor's pets  . Anyway , I remember they had a ,  they had this fish in there called an Oscar .  And they are these like , .. they are these really , I remember , yeah th- they're big . .. They're these big gnarly suckers . They're like um , Yeah , I remember what they look like . 2..   They're like m- -- f- -- I don't know , six or eight inches , big eyes ,   and they've got , ... they only eat like other fish . They eat like all fish . (SNIFF) And they eat like , ... you know like goldfish . And I guess goldfish or guppies , get the brunt of everything . .. Poor guys . They're like the , you know , they're like the cattle of the animal world . They're bred only to feed other things , Yeah , feeds . Yeah , they're feeders .  anyway ,  anyway so , They're nothing but tanks of feeders , in every pet shop  .  I remember w- watching them feed the Oscar once , when I was a kid . ... And they dropped in the goldfish , and I don't think I'd ever seen it before . Maybe I did , I don't remember . But this time particularly sticks in my mind . He drops the goldfish into the tank , and the goldfish goes and sw- swims around , minding his own little business , eating glop and all that shit , you know , that fish do , and the Oscar sneaks up behind it , and opens its mouth . And like creates a vacuum .. kinda thing cause ,  Oh my God .  you got this huge mouth , that sucks the goldfish in . Oh my God , right from the water .  2.. Yeah 2.. and , 2.. and then , And it doesn't even  -- and then uh , But the goldfish got stuck . .. half-way into his mouth None . It went the wrong way . No , it was going , Fin first ? it was going , .. Mouth first ? .. Well it was going , it went tail first . That's the problem . I guess that's the wrong way ,  That's the problem . I don't know .  Anyway ,   .. So , you got this Oscar there , swimming around in the tank , I learned a lot from that snake .  with like , ..   .. a goldfish , sticking out of his mouth , you know , .. the .. the head of a goldfish , so you could see the little goldfish's eyes , and his little mouth going , gbloop , .. bloop , .. bloop , .. bloop , and the Oscar's there swimming around , and you could tell the little goldfish , I mean they don't have what you would call , ... massively expressive faces ,  ..  None but I think it was worried .  You know   , it g- it's going , bloop bloop bloop bloop , and it's got these like wide-open eyes , you know , : None I was just imagining what was going through its little mind ,  2.. 2 as the Oscar was swimming around , frantically trying to dislodge it , so it could swallow it . You know ? And um , ... finally it d- did manage to , you know , v- like .. loosen it , Spit it out ? I don't know- remember if it spat it out or , cack it up . or what . But it managed to like nan , ... you know , .. dislodge it . Mhm . Dislodge it one way , and then swallow it . ... Well .. um , ... ... I .. wanted to say I'm really happy with the stuff ... I got now , ...  Good . .. Good .  And I'm really basically I'm back for a tape deck . ... Oh okay . So .. um , .. one of my thoughts is , ... that .. um , ... .. well , ... I want a tape deck .. that's gonna sound about , ... you know , as good as it can , Okay , and I think I want a tape deck with two -- .. places for two tapes , so I can copy , .. Okay .  but I've never done this before . I don't know much about tapes . I mean I h- -- Okay . .. I have a ... boombox , you know ordinary sort of thing . Sure . ... So , ... I wonder if you would .. suggest that this .. Luxman ... is the- -- ... is w- one of the things you'd wanted me to think about . None ... Um , ... ... the uh -- ... ... Would you -- ... you would want the -- .. the ability , .. uh , .. of the double cassette deck , ... just purely for ... taping from one tape to the other ? ... That's its main purpose . .. In fact I wouldn't know what other purpose it .. would have . Oh okay . The other benefit is , .. is if , .. you can load up two tapes in it , ... like , let's say two ninety minute tapes of music . Unhunh , .. I see .  And you can set a switch on it , I see . ... where it will continually play , Okay . ... Okay . ... all four sides , of two tapes . I see . ... That's probably not gonna happen . Okay . No . .. It's mainly for copying . ... Okay . So , .. And the tapes you'd be copying , ... uh , ... are they gonna be straight music ? ... Mmostly . .. Okay . Yeah . ... Okay . Yeah . So you are gonna want , ... or desire a pretty .. decent , ... uh , ... copy of your original tape . Mhm , ... right . Okay . ... Um , ... And the originals will be from music lovers , you know , .. who probably have , ... pretty good systems . .. Not -- Okay . I'm -- we're not talking stratosphere . Sure . .. But -- Sure . .. Anyway . Okay . ...  Um , ... because on a , .. um , ... a tape deck like that , ... you realize , that you're not gonna be able to get a copy that's , .. you know , .. Mhm , as perfect as . mhm , the original source was , mhm , .. or even as that tape was . .. mhm , There is gonna be some loss , ... mhm , .. in the generation of making that copy . mhm , ..  (H:) And -- Is there a way to avoid that loss ? I mean how -- ... ...  -- Well , .. you're you're gonna have that loss , .. just .. ... because of all the different things involved , Right . f from , .. taking it from one tape , .. and putting it on the other tape . Right . Right . There's a lot of things in the signal path there . Right . So you're .. you're bound to lose something . ... Yeah . .. It's not huge , No matter what . you know , it may be ten percent , Okay . or , five percent , Right . or something like that . Right . ... Right .  .. Uh which is a all amount , .. and , ... you'll st- ... still ... be able to enjoy the -- ... the music , ...  and the message it's trying to 2..  2.. bring across . Mhm , mhm , 2.. mhm , 2.. okay . So , Okay . I don't see a problem in that . .. Um , .. the other thing I realize is , ... uh , ... think about how much of the time you're gonna be doing that . ... Mhm , Because of- -- .. You are paying a decent premium , .. to have that convenience . mhm , mhm , ... mhm , so what kind of price difference are we talking about . Suppose I just get one tape .  Oh , okay None   And let my friends copy tapes for me and , Okay ,  yeah . um , Right . ... like let's say there would be about ,  ... um , ... couple different steps . Okay , Okay , one would be , ... a single cassette deck ,  ... um , .. that would , ... uh , ... play the tape , ... you know , and after side A's done , then you have to take the tape out and flip it over , and play side B . Okay . ... Okay .  Okay , Right . that would be your first level . .. Right .  And Luxman has a great cassette deck , .. to fill ... those needs . Okay ,  .. And um ,  ... all of their cassette decks come with a five year parts and labor warranty , so the quality's , mhm , ... you know , .. put into them . ... Uh , mhm , ... They really put a lot into them , to be able to give that kind of warranty , mhm , (H:) and um , ... they're pretty conservative in their , .. uh , ... specifications , where , ... what they say their cassette decks will do , ... they will ... y- usually out perform that . .. Okay . ... And , with the unit you already have , the receiver , that has the full remote control , Right .  all the units , uh , you're looking at here , will , .. uh , ... ... go along with that , Mhm , .. and , .. um , ... as far as the remote control funtions go . right . Where the remote control will control the decks . Right Right . Okay The decks come with ,  .. what's called a DIN cable , ... and that plugs into the unit you have now . Mhm , .. right .  okay this is the kay one eleven . ... Okay . ... This would be , I guess you'd say the entry level , .. Right ,  to integrate into your system . .. okay . (H:) Um , .. .. this gives you , ... a lot of pluses that , .. most people's basic decks don't have . Hm .  Okay , it has Dolby , ... Mhm , which as you know , that's a circuit to cut the tape hiss , ..  without cutting the high frequencies . right . ... Right .  And um , .. regular Dolby is Dolby B . ... That's like um , Mhm , .. when you buy tapes at the Wherehouse , .. they're .. in Dolby . right . ...   Um , ... in addition to that it gives you Dolby C . .. Mhm ,  When you're making your own tapes at home , like let's say from the CD , hm . Mhm ,  making a tape to play back on this tape deck , mhm , you're gonna wanna record it in Dolby C . mhm , That's gonna sound sonically superior . mhm , .. Um , or if friends are recording tapes in Dolby C , then you'll be able to play it back and it'll sound right . Hm Okay ,  Okay , so if something's recorded in Dolby B , you wanna play it in Dolby B , .. Dolby C , you wanna play it in Dolby C . You don't want to , Mhm , mix and match . Uh , okay , ... the- -- ... It doesn't sound quite right . ... Nkay ,  So this gives you that , hunh .  it also gives you what's called HX Pro . Okay , ... mhm , Which is a feature usually only found in , .. rh , ... really expensive cassette decks . Mm . .. Hm . (H:) And that i .. is , ... .. an improvement in the recording section of it , Hm .  and it allows you to record a little bit , Mhm , um , higher record level , .. so you hear less tape hiss , mhm , mhm ,  and also has a little bit more , .. um , high frequency response . ..  Hm . Mhm , Okay , so this one here you're looking at three hundred eighty dollars , mhm , ... hm . .. Mhm , Okay , .. and .. um , .. .. from there , ... the next step , ... for what you're looking at , would be the kay one ten . ... Okay the kay one ten basically has all functions that we just talked about on the- on the kay one eleven , Mhm , ... um ,   with the addition of , the convenience feature of having auto reverse . .. Yeah , And that's nice , just like in the car .  , .. Where , Yeah ,  it will play ... .. side B , after side A is finished , .. automatically . Yeah , ... Where you don't have to get up and flip the tape .  okay . The other thing about it is , you can flip the tape over at any point ... in the middle . Mhm , ... right . Uh , ... and , ... the other thing , ... y- let's say if you're entertaining , .. you can put in a ninety minute tape , Mhm , .. put it on continuous auto reverse , m mhm ,  have a recording of your favorite songs , right . Mhm , for a party , right . a dinner party , whatever , Right .  and , ... play side A , then side B then side A side B , Yeah , that's good . it'll just go forever . That's good . Okay . Okay . Um , Right . .. so that's what it gives you in the kay one ten .  mhm ,   Now , ... the , ... dual , ... or double cassette deck , .. that Luxman offers , is basically , ... a .. um , ... double version .. of the kay one ten . Right .  And they call it the kay one ten doubleu . .. Okay . .. ... And- -- So what's the price difference here . Oh okay , I'm sorry , .. the- -- Yeah . the kay one ten .. is four hundred eighty dollars , .. Alright . ... and the kay one ten doubleu , is five hundred eighty dollars . Mhm , ... okay .  Okay . So you paid a hundred dollar premium for auto reverse , then you're paying another hundred dollars to have , Yeah  , right . .. double cassette deck that's auto reverse . Okay . Mhm , okay .  Um , the convenience on this is obvious . .. Mhm ,  Where , ... um , ... they even have ,  .. um , ... you know , buttons set up for , Mhm , dubbing , .. or copying , mhm , from one tape deck to the other . .. mhm , Um , ... ... so it's really set up , .. to be .. just cranking out , hm , .. uh , .. copies . mhm ,  Now the other thing is , .. it has a feature where it will do it in half the time . hm . ... Or high speed dubbing . Hm . Hm . Hm . .. Hm . ... Which is sometimes nice , .. so it doesn't take the whole period of time . Right .  To make your copy . ... Mhm ,  And it will continue making the copy , you know , from side A then , and it'll flip over , Right . and to side B . .. Um , ... ... so we -- we've talked about it , how -- how it has the dubbing speed select buttons , Mhm , so you can make a , ... a high speed copy , mhm , um , ... The other thing that sets this apart , from a lot of other dual decks , is it has a separate Dolby button , ... for each cassette deck . ... .. Mhm . Ge- -- uh .. gesundheit . ..  Thank you . .. ... ... yeah . Um , ... where a lot of units will , Hm . ... just have a Dolby setting , .. Mhm , and that's the same for both decks .  I see . I see .  But there may be a situation , where a friend of yours , Yeah . Mhm ,  who's a real audiophile , made uh -- mhm , a real premium tape for you , mhm , recorded in Dolby C . mhm ,  Well , ... you wanna record it in Dolby B , so you can play it back in your Walkman ? Mhm , .. and in your automobile's cassette player . mhm , .. mhm , Uh , .. in that scenario , you're gonna want to play it back in Dolby C , but record it in Dolby B .  Yeah . .. Okay . Okay ? That's good . So this gives you that convenience . (SNIFF) .. Nkay .  Now the other thing is , let's say , (H:) um , that friend of yours came over for dinner with his prize tape , Mhm ,  and you had your prize tape , mhm , of of something else , you could load them both up , mhm , ... mhm , put it on continuous ,  ... um , ... unhunh ,  auto reverse , .. and it will play side A side B of one tape ,  ... go over to the other tape , right . and play sed ai -- Mhm , ... side A , .. then side B , .. and it continually go forever right , ... Okay .  Um , ... Hunh . ... which is kinda nice . Wow . .. Now the other thing None you can do with this deck .. is , Yeah . ... in your system , ... you can make a copy , from tape to tape , ... while you're listening to something else , (BLOWS_NOSE) ... nkay , Unhunh , so you could be listening to your CD right . while you're making a tape copy . Right That's right . .. Okay .  Um , the other thing you can do is , .. um , ... as I recall , ... one can listen to ... the tuner ,  ... so you could put on  KDB , Mhm , or I -- I- nan . right . nan .. there's one Matt likes , .. I forget what it's called None , .. but anyhow ,  Right .  um , ..  or he wants to get KFAC I think it is . Yeah .   Which is kind of tough . Um , so you could be listening to the radio , ... while taping a CD . Mhm , ... You- you know , right . it allows you to do that . Right . .. Right . ... Okay . ... Which , ... you have to pay attention to what you're doing  , Okay . I know . That's right . Yeah .  yeah , ... but at least you have that flexibility . Okay .  And so it sounds like ,  from ... what you've told me , ... uh , ... you know , about you're desire to make , ... good quality copies of tapes , Mhm , .. mhm ,  this is gonna be the tape deck , mhm , that would fit your needs . mhm , .. And integrate well with your system , and ,  right . allow the remote to fully control it . .. Okay . Well what you've said helps me a lot . .. I actually ... may , ... I mean , I don't do this so often . .. And it may well be that I -- ... I'd do better , .. just going back to one of these others . .. Mhm , Um , ... in --  The oth- -- ... in fact , I'm -- the oth- -- .. the other thing I was gonna say is , is it -- do you have , .. um , ... if you had some other type of quality cassette deck . .. Mhm ,  Even if it was a ,  unf -- mhm , ... one in the office , or uh , mhm , ... yeah . a portable or something like that , mhm , I could somehow hook it up into your system . ... mhm , So you could tape from it , right . 2.. Right .  to , ... one of these . Right , .. okay , .. that's possible .  And , the- -- the prices I gave you were the , uh , Luxman suggested prices , Right , ... since you've bought couple pieces here , mhm , and also been through the fire , .. I'm sure we can work something else out for you , mhm , I don't know , okay , how well , ... h , ... let's see here , ... ... um , ... the kay one eleven , .. which is the -- the basic one , Right . ... but .. h , .. I don't -- ... When I say basic , .. I mean basic in their line , Right . it's still very good , Yeah ,  uh , .. you'd be looking at three hundred forty-nine dollars ,  .. nkay , ... .. The , uh , ... ... let's see here , the kay one ten , mhm , ... uh , ... we could do four hundred .. and fortyfive , .. right , ... and the kay one ten doubleu , ... uh we could do five thirty nine . ... mhm , okay . ... Well , that looks great . ... And I th- -- .. I believe , .. there's one that we didn't talk about , and that's the kay one twelve . .. Mhm ,  Okay , and the kay one twelve is basically the audiophile's dream cassette deck .  ... Okay , mhm , it's a -- it's a single cassette , .. and it's single direction , mhm , where it doesn't flip over by itself . .. right ,  What sets it apart , is it has three discrete heads . ... hunh . Okay , and this will make a superior tape copy , Hm . um , .. or a superior tape period . Um , Hm . because it has three heads . ... Hm .  And what it does , is that it has a separate head for record , .. a separate head for play . ..  Hm . Where most decks have a combination record play head . .. Unhunh .  ... And nan , ... um , this also has some adjustments on it , ... uh such as bias fine trim , .. Hm .  uh , which allows you to , tailor .. the cassette deck's electronics , to the specific tape you're using . Mhm ,  So obviously you can see there's -- right . ... a b- -- a bit more  involved with it . Yeah . .. Yeah .  For the purist , ... this is the way to go . .. None Here you're looking at six hundred dollars . Okay .  Okay . ... .. Right . ... Okay , well this is very helpful . Let me ask you one other thing .  .. Suppose that , I wanna use this tape deck , to record , ... um , .. conversation . Like we do in -- in linguistics . .. Between Matt and me , or something like that .   Okay . Then , ... how does it work . .. Let's say go back to the kay one ten . Uh , Or the one -- there's one deck here , I think , that's set up for that . or the one el- eleven . ... Let's take a look here . The kay one ten , ... Mhm ,   has provisions , for microphones , on the front . unhunh .  And it's one of the few cassette decks , Okay , made for the consumer hi fi market today ,  that do have that . okay . (H:) And so , you can plug in one microphone , ... Yeah . uh , where it has a position , .. uh , that's mono , ... Mhhunh .  and it will record it on both tracks of it , Mhm , None -- mhm , and then if you want , hm . you can plug in two mics , and it senses when you plug in the second mic , Hm ,  okay . and so it'll record in stereo .  Okay . And then it has a record level on it , Hmhm , so you can adjust the record level , mhm , dependent on how loud you're talking , .. mhm ,  .. and then also the type of tape you're using , mhm , and the level you want on the tape . hm . .. Hm . ... Uh , so the kay one ten would be set up for that . Hunh .  Any of the other , um , cassette decks here , Mhm ,  the kay one eleven has it too . I Take- -- hunh . I- -- I take it back . ... Huh . I didn't think the kay ele- lev- one eleven did . Unhunh , ... unhunh ,  Okay it's the -- .. it's the dual one that doesn't . .. okay . ... The dual one does not have those provisions . now that doesn't mean that it cannot be done . .. Right .  What has to happen then is , uh , ... one .. hooks up a , Mhm , a separate outboard piece , called a microphone amp . okay .  Okay , and so what happens is , your mic runs into it , Mhm ,  and then it plugs into your receiver , mhm , into one of its inputs . okay .  And so one of your inputs on your receiver ,   let's say tape two , None Paul , Mhm , would actually be a microphone . run , run . mhm , Yeah . And so you would hit that , Yeah . mhm , and that would , .. um , Paul saved my ass None . go over , mhm , um , ... nkay . ... into your tape deck , if you wanted to record a tape . Right . ... Right . .. Okay . So um , ... m .  So the kay one ten , ... which is the single auto reverse , Yeah . has the mic provisions , Right .  the kay one eleven  has the mic provisions . And so's the kay one -- Okay . Great . .. Okay . The b- -- the benefit of the one ten ? ... The big benefit is the auto reverse . Right . Um , .. I'm one of these weird people that has trouble with auto reverse .  oh yeah ? I don't know why . The first time -- I mean , this is the first time I've had it , on my boombox . .. And for some reason , ... maybe I just have to learn , when I  put the tape in , I never know which direction it's gonna go . .. So I have a hard time finding -- What you want ? making it play what I want it to play . Okay . The way it usually works is ,    um , the side of the tape that's .. out . Or facing you ? ... that label side ? Mhm , .. mhm , corresponds with the arrow , that will point to the right . .. There's usually two little arrows that will light up , nkay . Yeah , telling you which direction it's playing . right . Right . Okay the arrow that points to the right , ... I see . is , the label .. side of the tape that's facing you . .. Okay . That you can see . Okay . ... Okay that's the way it usually works . Okay . Now the other thing that throws people off is ,   fast forward and rewind , Mhm , .. will ... vary , depending on which side of the tape you're on . right . .. Right . ... Right . Okay , that's what throws people off , Yeah . .. all the time . Yeah . .. I just um , .. I'll -- .. I'll work on getting used to that . .. But I just might go with the single -- .. you know , the one that I have to turn it over , None Oh , I mean , None you know , that's fine None . you know  , That's fine . Um ,   ,   .. I'm trying- -- .. I mean I had a couple recently , uh , Bodeckers , uh , ... got the kay one eleven , and- -- .. and they love it . Yeah . They don't play tapes that much , Yeah . That's the same with me , .. too . Yeah . .. I'm really into CD's now . Unhunh , yeah . So , But they have a couple of these box sets of uh , (SNIFF) right . symphonies , right .  and then I think they even have a couple books on tape , Yeah ,  and for that it's perfect . right . You know , .. it's probably w- .. more than enough . Right . (SNIFF) Right . Um , I'm just trying to look and see what other differences there are , Okay , I- I mean , I really think those are the -- ... that's the big difference . this is -- .. No , this is great . ... Um , ... ... doo doo , ... I believe , ... yeah . .. I think that's the basic difference , is that auto reverse . (H:) Let me ask you , do you sell microphones . .. Here . .. Uh , .. we don't really , None Nya nya nya nya nya nya . Kay . get into them . Nkay . Um , we are , Nya nya nya nya nya nya . um , You can't get me None . connected with a distributor that does deal with them . ... Okay .  And so we -- .. we've gotten them for clients time to time , Try to get me .  Okay ,  um , .. I think we have them available from Sony ? ... ... And , ... I'd really have to l- research that a bit for you . that's okay . I -- I can follow through on that . You have any idea how much a good , Okay . sort of um , .. table .. mic .. would cost ? .. Um , ... Well , .. um , you can get one , ...  f None ah s- -- .. I would say , ... I would expect to pay , maybe f- f- forty dollars , and up . .. Okay . I mean really , .. the sky's the limit with microphones . Right . right . I mean you can get , Okay . n- -- ... thousand dollar microphones .  Okay . But , um , .. you would proba- -- ... I would spend , ... you know I wouldn't spend nineteen dollars . Mhm , mhm , I'd spend forty bucks , yeah . 3.. Yeah . 3.. Okay . and then , .. maybe a little up above that . Nkay , mhm ,  For what you wanna do , I- .. I don't ever see paying , you know , a couple hundred dollars , mhm , that -- .. that would probably be , ... right . f- very overkill . Okay . ... So that kind of gives you an idea . Mhm right . Okay . Um , there's a place to look , .. um , .. called Sound Advice . .. Yeah . ... Alright . Okay , there's a guy there named Wayne Yeah . ... Okay , ... He's uh ,  that's a good idea . one of the principals there . .. Wayne , Okay . I think his name is Shaybeck . ... Alright . .. Saybeck Shaybeck , something like that . And he's a really knowledgeable guy , Okay , he's been in the business for a long time , great . uh , .. and they're good guys there . ... Okay , ... So that would be , a a place to look at a mic .  okay , ... that'd be great . .. Yeah . ... Um , if we needed to d- get a price on a ... tape r- recorder , that we lost . See what we lost was a tape recorder , not a tape deck . Okay . It was a fancy Uher ? That name rings a bell ? Are y- -- Oh really . It was . Yeah . Oh gosh . Right . Th- that's None  like , But -- .. considered , I mean there's a lot of different models of Uhers , Mhm ,  but uh , .. they've always been considered , probably one of the finest portable cassette recorders . mhm , mhm , .. yeah . .. Right .  uh nan w -- our blue book usually shows the Uhers . ... Yeah . Our older Uhers . Okay . .. So I could show you what the blue book price was , Then 2.. if I -- Nkay . it's gonna be hard to d- -- Okay . I don't know Uhers that well , .. it's gonna be hard to determine , Mhm , what would be a comparable replacement today . I know . .. Right . .. Yeah . And that would be something you may wanna run by Wayne . ... Okay . ... Great . ... Nkay . You don't sell that kind of thing here . Right ? Cause this is an audio nan .. That's right . nan place . well I mean , Okay . ... to tell you the truth , th- sometimes we do get them for people . Mhm , ... okay . Through the distributors we deal with . Yeah . ... But uh , Yeah . .. Okay . .. overall ,  Well , usually we don't . None  this is great . Yeah . What I think I'll do is um , take these ideas back to Matt , Okay . and I'll be back . Sleep on it , ... then yeah . yeah . ... Yeah . I need to think about what you told me . h , But this is very helpful for me . okay , I really appreciate it . just for your knowledge , .. um ,  the kay one ten ? and the kay d- one ten doubleu , ... Mhm ,  that's the auto rev- -- single auto reverse , right . and double auto reverse , .. we have in stock . .. Okay .  The kay one eleven , .. Hm . um , I don't believe I have in stock , but we're gonna be placing a Luxman order soon . .. And , since they ship out of Torrance , .. Mhm ,  um , ... you know , lead time isn't too bad on it . but just know that , mhm , you couldn't call me up and then listen to a tape that night . right . Okay . .. That's fine . Okay . Okay . ... Um , .. but , .. we're talking like maybe a week or something . Oh . Yeah . Okay . Yeah . No problem .  If that . I mean listen . If that .  I'm not that uh  , Okay . th- the timing isn't that tight . I've waited a long time , Okay . for a lot of stuff , so , no . Okay , It's not a big problem . But I appreciate your letting me know about that . okay . Okay . .. Um ,  Okay , .. Pete had told me Matt came by , and picked up some literature on , ... I th- guess the l- ... l- -- s- the little speakers , y- .. we were talking about .  right . I don't , I don't , Okay . I don't know if he actually got the exact one I recommended , or not , Yeah . and then , .. uh , .. there was an article on uh , FM antennas , I had recommended to him . Mhm . And Pete made a copy of it for him Yeah Okay . Okay . That's great .  Yeah . That was really helpful . So -- Do you- --  5.. had you heard anything , .. ha- has he .. read that and he's thinking --  Right . thinking -- Yeah . Okay good . That was part of what we had to That was part of what we had to put in the specs . We needed to know the size , and this whole antenna question , whether you could put an antenna , ... you talked about this with him , Okay . un- -- .. under the roof and everyth ,  Yes . ... cause you know . .. You can't have that stuff showing . That's right .   That's right . Not .. where we are . Yeah .  Yeah . Uh , Okay . how's the house moving along .   ... Coming along . We're gonna be , .. putting the uh , .. specs out for bids . Great . Within the month . So , Great . yeah . ... That's progress , So , that's -- isn't it . It's progress .   Yeah . We're going as fast as we can . We're gonna have , like , four weeks we just have to wait . While the bidding . .. Exactly .  And um , .. but  -- Well , then if , .. then if you sit up at night thinking , Then  -- .. should we go for him , 2 I know it  . or should we go for him .  It's just what I was telling Jeff . I said we got all these places in the .. specs , where we're -- ... we're having to say , you know . ... K- -- ... Figure this one separately , cause we may have to axe it . .. You know . And we're just , ... .. biting  our nails , cause we don't know , what th- the bottom line is gonna be . Sure . Th- -- Yeah . So None maybe uh , ... anyway . Some parts of it will really surprise you , None Yeah None .  and some parts will , ... be a lot less than you thought . Yeah . ... Like windows aren't as expensive as I thought . .. So , .. it's -- Oh . That's how it's going . Well that's good . .. Yeah . Well you have to do , .. double glazed up there now . Yeah  . That's TRUE .  ... Right . .. Yeah . Um , which some t- -- which adds a bit . Yeah . To the cost goes up . Well , we'll keep you posted on , Okay . how it's all going , Just let me know . and I'll certainly let you know about this thing , .. um , I'll be calling you back . Okay . Within a few days . And I- -- I think I had given you some literature before  . Yeah . On that . And it shows those cassette decks in there . Okay . If you need an additional piece , That's right . I can -- I- I can get you one . h no you're -- I think you're right . Okay . .. Yeah that's what I had looked at . So , I think , ... is w- -- no . You don't have the -- I have the d the -- one , the double one here  , right . Right .  And I have the , That's what I saw . the real high end , um , Mhm , .. single one . yeah . .. Okay .  Alright . The other t- -- ... the other , the single auto reverse , .. I have in stock , I just don't have on display . Yeah . That's alright . Yeah .  Okay . Okay . ... Good . ... Thanks so much . Well that gives you an idea . Alright . .. Good . Okay good . I kept you five minutes , but I bet- -- Oh . .. I bet it's been worse than that before . It's -- it's -- Oh . This is nothing .  Yeah . This is nothing . This is a joy . Hunh .  To tell you the truth . Good . ... Good . ..   .. Well I think you've got another sale . Okay . .. So , Okay . .. Well , just have to talk to Matt . thank you , .. Yeah . .. Hm . .. yeah . ... And even if I go out and ask for it . you know , I say , can I copy that . .. I won't feel guilty . ... I really won't None . .. It's just a set of instructions , I used to program . a little bit , and , and um , ... those guys have so much fun writing those programs . ... you know , .. that's the -- ... I think that's -- .. that's pretty --   Yeah well , (%) That's pretty much the end of it . creative people generally do what they love to do .  Yeah , right . .. And that's pretty much the end of the truthful part of the process . The rest of it is all marketing . .. Hm . and the marketplace is uh , .. you know , .. maybe I think I live in Tangiers .  you know ? .. Maybe I think the marketplace is uh ,  you get what you can get . .. yeah . ... .. Uh , ... seems to be that way . you know , I- as long as I'm not hurting another person directly , Right . .. You know ? or even indirectly . ... but just throwing my money out there , he may never see a penny of it . he may have sold the rights .  outright .  You know ?     That certainly happens in music , Heavens yes . I- yeah . Yeah . .. You know ? I mean it .. happens all over the place . You know I wish I was , uh , the person , .. whose voice they used in the .. telephone , when it tells you , ... the number has been changed , .. And that I had uh , copyright ,  get some royalties . Like , that lady , you know , h- you hear , ... the number you have reached , da-duh da-duh da-duh da-duh da-duh da-duh None . they got a different woman , didn't they . .. Hunh ? didn't they get a different woman ? .. When she th- tried to do that ? I don't know if they did . they , they , they hired another voice . I didn't hear any followup . but , that's what I thought that they did anyways . Yeah ? ... hunh . ... they certainly use her a lot . ... But I mean it- -- they only use , what . a s- -- five seconds total or something ? You know , it's a- -- ..   Probably took her a long time to , .. to say every possible combination . oh but , they -- the computer does that . All she has to do is say each digit . .. and the computer , Oh that's all it is . .. Yeah . .. it's like a series of samples . .. And it automatically sorts em . .. Unhunh , Yeah . right . yeah . .. so it's , .. .. Probably the total actual .. s- speaking that they use , is pretty short . ... It would be much more pleasant if they had done all the combinations though . ... .. You know , call it up , and there's something that actually .. says your number , .. in toto , .. You know  ? Yeah . Or , because it recognizes your phone number , it automatically goes into the computer , finds that , Yeah , and -- a and names the name , that sample .  ... Thank you Mister ith , for calling Pacific Bell .  yeah , right . You know ,   I am your personal computer representative . That'd be great .    None Push one , if you wish to know my phone number , .. push two , if you wish to h-  --   My phone number that I -- you know have dinner with me , push three ,    if you want to uh ,  h --  Artificial intelligence personality , that you call up , Yeah  so , if you do not like this personality , push zero , and a new personality , Yeah  .  will be provided for you , Yeah . at no extra charge . Yeah . Hunh .  You are allowed up to five personalities in one phone call .   ..  ..  .. well the networking of computers is getting uh such that , .. you know , ... almost anything's possible . .. Any  -- Yeah , that's why I .. like it . It's just matrixing , and , just , con- constantly , building and building , upon building upon building , on these complexities , and building controllers for them , That's right , and , and building on top of those . And you're building on the thoughts of th- your predecessors ,  but your predecessors , in this case , could be like .. last year .  You know it's like , it's moving so fast , Oh . So fast .  It's like a r- --  It's a reflection of the brain , ... and it's communication like books , but it's much quicker . ... And it's like , but when they get -- if you can think of something and define it , you can .. make it happen . ... If it just about information . .. I mean you can't --  If it's just about information , that's very TRUE . Yeah . 2.. You can't conjure something up , ... like a car out of nothing . .. But , ... well with the superconductors , ... uh , .. that's gonna make it , .. you know , so economical , .. mhm . for everybody , .. to have , .. all the electronic , .. this and that that they want , because there'll be so little loss of electricity , .. Yeah . .. And it'll be all . You know and it -- .. It'll be f- so all , that we'll have enormous amount- -- uh -- we should have an enormous ... supply of it , .. yeah like , every light switch will have its own computer or something you know . .. Basically , because it'll be cheap enough that , ... cheap as a switch these days or something , it won't cost anything . you know ? ky- -- and it -- and when they go into outer space , and start growing this .. thi- those uh , silicon chips without any flaws , Hm .  they'll be able to uh , .. grow circuitry that is so complicated , that , .. you know , ... that gravity destroys it . so they'll be able to uh , Hm . uh , Yeah . to- -- i- they'll be able to get these fantastic uh circuits , f- like say for a whole television set , just on one chip . .. And uh   ... uh , and then it'll harden out there , and k- they'll bring it back . ... a- .. uh , the whole thing is s ,  is s , .. is so sensational . ... That'll be expensive at first . ... God . But can you -- growing em in space , but that's great . yeah . it'll -- it'll uh , ... it'll be worth it . In -- ... This technology out of most of , .. uh m , .. anything in the past , ha- has m- -- ... it's becoming like we're shaping our ... our destiny , or ourselves . ... um , ... with this technology , more than we have in .. with any other in the past , it seems .  .. just blike , whatever we think it b- -- .. we can .. make it . .. but there's one technology that's um , .. gonna overtake that , and that's DNA research . .. which is , like , a total scam at this point , still it's , they're just like , .. bombarding ... rganis with radiation , to see what comes up . ... you know . We have very little control over it . .. But once we do , .. we'll be able to program biology as well . .. Well that's pretty frightening concept .   It is frightening but , .. We can't even control our freeways . um , I know . you know ?  I mean , but , i- -- the thing is , any s- technology that comes up , it gets used . ... Once it's out there in the open ,  the- -- Well I hope -- the society as a- a whole , I hope they use fractals . .. Are you familiar with fractals ? Unhunh . .. Yeah , I hope they use a lot of fractals . Because f -- in biology research ? None No . But in , well , the connection between mathematics and biology , can be found k- -- unhunh . uh , more easily with fractals , than it can with uh regular mathematics . Yeah .  Yeah . ... So , .. you know , I'm looking for the p- connection , between science and , and religion and , .. and and and biology , mhm . as it were , ar- -- th- you know , the living as spiritual , and the -- and the , Like the ancient science were , and the sci- -- and the scientific , .. Pardon ? it was , like the ancient science , it was just ... a branch of knowledge , which is- included all knowledge basically . Alchemy . alchemy . 2.. Right ?  Unhunh . yeah .  Whatever gets the job done . The- the- -- the gestalt .  .. the totality is taken into account , as opposed to , as opposed to the observer . Right . you know , I remember , m- back in the psychedelic days , there was this poster of the scientist . I've always been on a , .. kind of a crusade , .. for scientific uh , responsibility . Right ? And scientists are , are taking such control over the world these days . uh with their n , .. you know , not the scientists , but what they've invented . And the way it's marketed , and the way we're d- -- .. we develop needs for it . And I remember this pf- cartoon I saw w , .. of , .. of , .. it was called The Scientist . and it had this , .. this wonderful stone statue , about twenty stories tall , of a naked man , and a naked woman , .. intertwined with each other , hugging each other , full frontal , and their arms wrapped around each other , and then they s- -- .. they- they looked like they were so intertwined , and they spiraled down and , .. and they're a s- -- .. they're a statue . right , Hm . made out of stone . and they're , and the whole base of the statue is crumbling . ... Right ? And it's just like rubble . f- like from , .. just below the knees , down , was just kind of rubble . but the rest of it was all real clear , a few ttle -- .. some of it was chipped off , you know , it was old but , and d- -- and down at the bottom , of this , .. this rubble , .. was this little man . who was a scientist . And he had this big magnifying glass . and he was looking at the rubble . Looking with his head down ,  .. Hm . not looking up at the statue , and seeing the love , and the the- the- symbol there , but looking down at the crumbs , you know , Hm . at the rubble at the bottom . With his magnifying glass . .. and , ... and , .. to me that , .. that always symbolized , kind of rather clearly , the limitations of the scientific method . .. Whi- -- if it doesn't take into account , ... well , .. the .. to- -- .. the the the whole human experience , and , .. including , .. the .. unbelievable parts of it . .. the parts that are just legend . and myth . and , .. and uh , .. alluded to , you mean the theories . and , and the psychedelic experiences , and the subjective , oh , on that side . you know , and insanity , and ,  What , I mean , well , you know they -- ... nan They've got to take ac- into account ,   uh , but , .. you can't , the East , with all its , with all its fantastic discoveries . but you can't look at the stars with a microscope . ... And science is a microscope . ... Each .. pscientist has their , ... their field of um , ... expertise , .. and if they're gonna go , .. if they're gonna stretch out far enough into the -- ... the unknown . .. where they can find something new . They have to do it in a straight line . They can't do it , that's TRUE .  in all directions at once . Because then you run into things that we already know . .. So the problem is communication between s- -- but they're doing it , .. they're doing it with mathematics . Right ? ... I mean , Well , n- 2.. no . 2.. but the comm , .. problem is , .. communication between the branches of science . 2.. mhm . I think . ..  that's TRUE . cause , who's gonna .. be able to hold , all that knowledge , and make the connections . ...  Well , the philosophers , and the spiritual leaders , and , I mean , cause , .. f- the stuff can be understand , .. understood , ... The goals ,  .. Those people can tell you , or the , .. or the cutting -- cutting edge , can be understand -- .. understood intellectually ,  but those people can't tell you the details . .. they know the whole structure , but see , well the -- it's like both sides . You have to have somebody looking at the details , y- got to have a leader , and somebody looking at the --  and you got to have , a bunch of workers . You know ? Yeah . .. And you gotta have somebody , right . who disn't necessarily inclined to deal with the details that much , who's guiding , those who are willing to sit there , I guess that's the problem , .. and make all the -- we don't have a guider . .. yeah . there's no l , there's no lead , or there's no focus . yeah . and -- That's right . .. and uh , .. you know , .. I think , ... I think that , .. one of the reasons that there's been no focus is because , .. h , everybody accepted the scientific method as the best tool that we have ,  And was kinda letting the scientific method be the -- Mhm . .. be the leader . The -- the- w- you know , .. just continue inventorying and , Well those people who are doing research . .. continue inventorying , cataloging , experimenting , ... You know . ... documenting . ... uh , ... uh , whatever . and , instead of , .. instead of uh , ... uh coming at it from another direction . Trying to find , .. trying to find , .. uh , ... trying to find ways to , to , like .. with .. with Einstein for example , you know , uh , it seemed to me , he was trying to f- -- The was ex- .. per- -- experimenting with , with new ways of doing things , you know , well thinking about things .  h- -- uh and thinking about things , and he was trying to -- he w- -- I think he was ultimately trying to , ... trying to discover the speed of his own thought . .. Hm . You know , I mean , nan he was like , really off into wonderful abstract notions , that were all based in a peaceful ... world .  You know ? that couldn't exist unless he was secure . that we had a peaceful world . or that .. that .. peace .. was part of it . Of ... what he was .. about . and , so much of today's technology is soulless . and has nothing to do with peace , it has to do with , just generally , .. chewing up , .. you know , consumeri basically and , Mhm . .. chewing up -- ... ch- n- -- j- chewing up .. new w- -- uh , chewing up the human experience , and turning it into , some kind of consumer need . .. Did you ever get into Tesla ? .. uh , just , ever so peripherally . .. He had a lot of real .. wacky ideas on .. big levels . He wanted a world power system , that you could um , ... tap into the air basically , and get power anywhere on earth . ... and um , ..  y- -- that's what the Tesla coil was about ? Yeah . .. but , e- the problem was , that it , .. it uh , it interfered with um , ... well , matter .  I mean , y- -- it was not a clean broadcast system . Like everything in the room , if you had a Tesla coil in the middle of the room , all the metal objects would be receiving it constantly . Mhm .  So , .. it wasn't really a very efficient either . .. Because you'd have to have a- -- an immense amount of power being broadcast , so that , a few points could receive , .. you know , their share of it . ...  now what about , if they -- nan with the superconductor . Will that change all that ? ... I don't know . .. He was dealing with it being ... basically energy , and being sent through the air , uh you know , like light , like , .. yeah . Like tapping right into just the energy of the earth , or something . alright . yeah . which doesn't really .. require a conductor . yeah may- -- ... you know , I mean light will go through a vacuum . ... So , .. I think he was , .. I mean he va- basically invented the radio , .. and stuff like that , you know None . ... It's pretty confusing to me . but uh , .. yeah , those .. those guys are the guys I think that are the heroes , uh , or , .. that are the unsung heroes . yeah . You know , .. the r- -- the uh , and s- -- and and business and , I mean this is a cliche , but , but business has always uh , ... taken these works , and , .. and manipulated em , either , ... to their benefit , or , ... to our benefit , or to our detriment , or something , f- based on economic , .. wh- .. what the obvious , or the nan hm . nan more immediate economic --  Right . .. it's like , well , .. gee , yeah , I know I know how we can make money with this . ... I mean you just do it . yeah . .. Well that's what I like about fractals . is because uh , uh , ... with these new mathematical ... formulas ,  mhm . even though , .. you know , .. because it's mathematical , and it -- .. I- .. it has to work I guess with numbers in it . .. somew- some way . uh , .. it's opens a door into , .. what appears to be all the substance that's underneath the obvious . ... You know , hm . with -- if if regular math is the obvious , uh , .. these fractals seem to , ... seem to represent , .. everything that numbers aren't . and uh that's --  Well , something that numbers aren't . I don't think it's everything . not everything . but s- -- cause there are t , but the first window , into that . .. yeah . ... well , it -- like -- every theory is just like , .. it's a window , and it's also like a model of um .. reality , and it's really not reality . And uh , ... like a fractal can get really close at do- -- like describing growth patterns , like a plant or something . Yes . .. Yes . Right . .. Right . ..  Um , but , it's still n- .. not the totality of a plant , No it isn't , by any stretch . But for mathematics or for science , it's the- -- it's an opportunity for them to -- it's the closest thing we have .  to , yeah . To get closer to , to the chaos , or the , or the order of chaos , Mhm . Uh , that exists uh , uh a- h as subtext , to our life , to our experience on this planet . And when we're , Mm . and when we're say- -- ... when we're going to , uh , .. say blow up the first atomic bomb , and and and , we don't bother , to ask the American people , or the people of the world , if w- if if we mind ,   uh , if there's a chance you know , .. cause they didn't know for sure , whether .. it would destroy the universe or not . Yeah . Or not  .   And , It might have started a chain reaction that just blew up the whole earth . That's right . And it might very well still have started that chain reaction . And that it's all happening in fractal country , and it has -- Aah . and it , and it's manifesting itself in , in disharmony , uh , .. in , .. in the .. deterioration of the planet . We're all worried about the ozone , we're all worried about the uh ,  Hm . uh , th- cancer is everywhere , uh , so you're saying it might have done the same bad thing , but in a sort of more roundabout way . it's just that the uni- -- except that the universe is such a complex phenomenon , that it's so deep , it's f -- f- the fabric that we are witnessing , through m- science , and through any known ability to understand , Mm .  is just a thin shell from how deep , this phantaagorical experience goes , and that when they did that , it's possible that they started a chain reaction , at such a subatomic level , a sub sub sub sub subatomic level , it's gonna take a while to crumble .  that it'll take a while before it , .. it , it really , you know , .. vr- goes (ROAR) , you know , and just rips it apart . Yeah . it might take , ... it might take , .. a- a few th- -- it might take .. five hundred years . or a thousand years . Yeah . or a hundred years . or maybe it's be- -- w- maybe in v- fifty years . or it might never happen but , it's -- to me , that was scientific irresponsibility . And , w- without the knowledge of , .. of f , .. what fractals symbolize , at this point , to me , nan uh , .. they -- .. w- -- they could make that decision easier . ... And , with the sci -- fractals could have made the decision easier ?  No . No . Without the knowledge of fractals . The decision was made easier . If fractals were known at that time , oh . there might have been a little more caution , because there was , there's this window . but fractals don't uh , .. don't imply any .. particular morals . well they imply , no they don't imply morals , but they do imply that there's more than the obvious going on . .. Well all math does that . ... Uh , not to me . ... uh it's -- They're just another system , that's all , .. just another model . ... it's , to me it's a model , .. it's .. it's a model into the fourth dimension , as opposed to , you know , Well , .. actually , the third dimension . Einstein's theory is a model in the fourth dimension , and that's time . ... ... Um , .. but fractal can be applied to , ... many dimensions or n- -- .. or just , .. I mean , any number of dimensions . it's basically , taking something and dividing it up randomly . ... or , .. with some system . ... it's like nested , .. nested values . ... basically . ... Inside a gallon you have four quarts , inside of four -- ... in- .. inside a quart you have , the certain amount of cups , and then , you know . ... etcetera etcetera . .. ... well , I don't .. see how it's nan yeah , except it's not , it's not uh , it's not so , .. it's not squared , and it's not as predictable as that . I mean it's uh , it's , .. it's not predictable at all really . .. It's , .. it's a it's a found phenomenon .  Well it's not predictable if you apply random ... values to the ... subdivisions . ... The subdivisions have to be random . ... They ha- -- it has to .. have .. randomness to it . the order , I don't think is , ... is understood . ... yet . .. I mean I might be wrong , but that's my understanding . Hm . ... ... well , I think , that's why , .. they're calling it , .. the equ- -- they're calling it , .. uh , the mathematics of chaos . Oh , that's a different thing . That's not fractals . Yeah , that's fractals . ... It includes other -- well fractals can be used to describe chaos . .. it includes , it includes None other , .. it i- -- Yes . It can . And it includes other mathematics too . But fractals is separate . yeah . ... I mean , and chaos is se- -- they overlap . ... Mhm . ... Chaos I guess is basically analysis of noise . For- for the scientist , .. For the scientist , the scientist has never hav- -- has never had a tool , where he had that overlap . .. you see . Hm . ... see that's w- -- .. that's the point that I'm trying to get at . is is that , because the scientific method now has that tool of overlap , it's giving them something that they never had before . ... Hm . .. and , ... that is an opportunity for , .. to meet spirituality . ... Yeah well , .. there's u -- .. in physics .  There's opportunities to meet spirituality , .. twenty-four hours a day wherever you go . just by being alive . If they don't wanna see it , they're not gonna see it in fractals . Well yeah , a lot of people will . A lot of people will uh , it'll dawn on them , because .. they .. follow .. the scientific impulse , and , .. fractals may .. be the very thing that boggles them out enough , where they have to do some serious questioning about things . ... is my theory . .. Yeah , You know . .. Maybe . .. They'll probably find it in something , if there fractals weren't there . I think um , .. it's like all the .. the ideas that we have , throughout the ages , and the various , ... they're just sort of echos of uh , .. the past . And they come ... under different names and things . Just like um , .. the latest power now is corporations . Right ? And before that it was , ... like uh governments , before that it was , .. principalities , ... before that it was gangs , you know .   And tribes . And gangs are coming back , now , you know ? s- but uh , God , are they ever . um , .. it's unbelievable . And knowledge , and and .. the pursuit of um , .. spirituality , ... has taken on many forms , (COUGH) ... And if a person wants to find it in , .. in something they believe in , and they believe in science , they'll find it in science . ... well that's very TRUE , but I mean , uh- -- that -- I think that that -- .. that people who find spirituality in science , as their .. f- sole spiritual source are , .. people that are fucking up the planet . You know ? .. I don't think science is the -- I don't think science can be God . I've been watching Two Thousand And One lately . You know ? I mean that's what that's all -- i- -- that's not what it's all about , but that's a , a major theme in it . you know , that , .. the race between the human and the , and the tech -- mhm . .. and its , and its technological manifestation of , well I- -- you know , I think that , we built  -- it's like are we gonna be part of it , or are we gonna make it . Is it gonna m- .. do us , or are we gonna do it . you know , is our creation , it's like the Frankenstein myth . Is our creation going to uh , destroy us ? or are we going to continue . Yeah uh , look at what's on TV .  yeah . I just put it on .  Mandelbrot . .. oh , I just put it on . okay . .. Yeah . I see . ... I thought they were showing that on the uh .. ads , for some reason .  .. None A little too hip for TV . Little too hip , yeah . ... So they're color-cycling right now . ... Does it zoom later ? I guess it must .  Yeah , I've got zooms on here too . ... and I -- Where'd you tape it from . .. M uh , .. This one's Fractal Fantasy , which is , for sale . ... Hunh . .. and the other one is uh , ... Fractal Zooms , which I don't think is available , ... b- and then I've got a uh test film from .. IBM laboratories . of uh , f- uh , uh , .. taking a Julia set into the fourth dimension . .. Hm . ... which th- -- and then they zoom through it , it's pretty f- -- pretty fantastic looking They might not actually be , ... be um , ... back in the barn- -- or from the barn yet .  Good morning , this is Doctor Naretto at the Kingman Vet Service ?        None . I saw Tad this morning . yeah . Um , He's looking not too bad , Um , ... A little bit of pain in his abdomen . It's hard to know if he just has , a gastritis , .. or gastroenteritis , from chewing on that dead pigeon , or what the ... problem is . Um , what we ended up doing was , giving him some antibiotics , .. and sending him home , .. um , If he does not improve , we may need to take some rays , and he's got some bones , ... or something in there . I didn't feel anything in his belly , but , ... yeah . A lot of times if they get into garbage or dead things , .. they'll just get an upset stomach , .. and , um , also a little bit of uh , ... well , just inflamation in- .. in there . and and just feel bad . So , um , ... I , ... You know , Since he's not vomiting now , you can go ahead and feed him and stuff , and see , ... how he does , Um , hopefully the antibiotics will calm down any ... any infection , ... that he , h- that he might have gotten from all the bacteria on the dead pigeon .  um , but if he , if he doesn't get better , ... or if he gets worse , .. be sure and let us know . ... well , but- -- Already by tomorrow , he should be feeling a lot better . ... Um , and if he , if he isn't , or if he starts vomiting , or having diarrhea , we may need to see him . we -- we w- will need to see him again . ... so . um , Okay ? ... Mhm , you're welcome , mm bye . ... Sh- uh , what did you , .. what on your sheet , ... what was the cost for the cast that you charged about , ... what do we generally . I think it was like fifty . ... With the cast , Oh . to put it on . To actually put the cast on . Casting materials and then , ... Okay . ... And then um , ... She had -- ... pretty much when we rechecked her , she was ready to take it off . So we didn't have to do any ... more NAME? or anything . Okay . ... I'm trying to remember , I think , .. like , .. with the white , You got -- I thought you NAME? it . ... You NAME? it with the cast on . Yeah . Mhm .  Yeah . yeah , .. yeah . ... and it was ready to come off , and we took it off . ... She did a real good job of keeping it -- ((DOOR_CLOSE) .. keeping it clean , and ... dry . ... That's , .. I think , ... half the battle . cause , .. she didn't have any sores , or anything , when we took it off . Mm yeah . Kristen , for the , ... for the tranquilizer what do we , what is it again .  ten . Ten .   I wonder if she would need more . and it'll be -- ... Oh he'll , yeah . For a casting . to do a cast . ...   Biotal . if you just , biotal and , ... Metofane .  ... We just , or even -- we'll put him on the machine . ... And then you don't have to worry about em . ... What was , .. what would that -- that would be thirteen . ... Total ? or , ... thirteen extra . No . plus thirteen , for anesthesia . to put this .. cast on . .. Cause if you don't , then y- -- they're waking up , and you just , ... It's bad . end up spending more time , than if you just put em on the silly machine . Okay . Yep . ... As we know from the sheep . ... Well , and from other things too . ... Just -- ...  Yeah . Are those good ? .. Do you like em ? Yeah . ... Did you make em ? ... I made em . .. Yeah . .. ah -- I was thinking they were more like a , .. chocolate chip cookie bar . .. And then as I got through the recipe , I noticed that they don't have any flour in em .   ... They're good . So they're actually more like granola bars than nan They must have -- Yeah . nan cookie bars . .. Yeah . They've got brown sugar and butter , ... and nan Tastes like they have peanut butter . nan oatmeal , ... and peanut butter chips . ... chocolate chips . ... Okay , so a recheck would be about that much , with the .. nan Mhm , nan rays , and then , ...   ... Does that sound right ? thirtytwo , I think , f we -- .. she woke up , we could .. w- send her home tonight , ... I wouldn't see why we couldn't send her home tonight , would you ? If she wakes up , ... fine . ... Oh well , we're gonna be Biotaling her and oh , Sh- if sh- -- she probably won't , though never mind . Never mind . I was thinking , I'm still thinking ,  -- Na . Na na , ... na na na , ... And she won't have any an- antibiotics , Cause using all   , No . And that , ... Thirtytwo , ... What is this ? Ten , for anesthesia . Oh . But , they're still .. opposite . they're opposite . ... ... Yeah , .. That looks all right . .. Don't you think we should charge them an extra eighteen ? ...  For the distemper vaccine ? Trent does it ? ... No ? I felt horrible doing that on that .. eye dog , that he .. had in here last week , under whatever night it was . ... Cause he had down . ... twenty-five plus eighteen , and what can you do , when he's already got it down . jeez . ... Well , .. ... Well , all we did -- I can't do that , cause all we did was , ... I was in here and put a bandage on  . Yeah . Yeah .  Um , did you get hold of Dan ? ... then ? ... Yeah . .. He's --  ... Let's see . ... ... Six , Let me see , fiftysix , Let me see , we need .. one of these and one of these , ... one of those , and one of those , and two of those .  Three , Sent home with Amoxi ,  fiftythree , .. and Pred , .. So , .. We'll se how -- Yeah . Well , I'll call him probably late this afternoon , to make sure he's ... all right . RING ...  ...    ...  there ? ... No , I was just trying to figure out what we spent already . Mm . ... Mm . Let' see ,  ... We've already spent fifty for him , and I want him to spend another hundred . ... Well , But that's better than pins , ... Right , And surgery . Which would be another , ... two hundred or , ... Yeah . It's more for a surgery . to spend . ... Any -- pretty much any time you can -- And that one really , .. you know , I don't think it would benefit from pins , Mm . because , we'd have to undo it . I mean we'd have to , Well , we'd have to go ... we could -- we could try it closed , .. Mhm . ... But , .. still , it's more ... expensive . ... I think it'll do fine with a cast . especially since it's a spiral fracture . ... And it's not displaced . And it's not displaced . ... should be pretty stable . ... It'll be kind of a pain getting the -- .. well , .. maybe not , getting the cast over the stifle ? ... Maybe not . ... Well , as long as she's -- Got kinda long legs , As long as she's quiet . ... Okay ? ... I'll give him a call . I don't know if he's in the barn , .. from home . .. In back in from the barn yet or not . ...  .  Well ,  ...  called both the house number , and the barn number , and both of em , and , ... a little kid answered , Mm . ... Yeah and they're little .. little kids too .    , mhm ?  . None They're like ,  ,  , on three . ... Yeah Carol ? .. It's Marcia . ... Hi . um , we got NAME? done already , ... and , .. I was gonna let you know what , .. what was going on . ... Should I talk to Richard ? or .. you okay . ... Okay . Um , It looks like .. she's got .. a spiral fracture , Of um , .. of her tibia , which is the bone between the knee ... and the hock , .. and , .. um , It's f- -- it's really looks , .. pretty stable . It's not displaced very far anyway , and it's , um , .. pretty much , .. you know , locked in place , so to speak , um , so I think , that she would , .. she would do fine with a cast . ... Um , ... and , I pretty much got an estimate , so far , .. with the , ... coming in yesterday , and the NAME? and everything , ... the bill was about fiftyfour . .. And , to do a cast , .. um , ... with the anasthesia , and staying one more night in the hospital and stuff , and then the casting material , .. probably the -- It's gonna be about a hundred and fiftythree , total . ... And , the only , then it would be , ... the only extra would be , in about six .. to eight weeks , we'd have her come in again , we would tranquilize her , and take the rays , and see if it's .. healed . .. Enough to take off . .. And that's generally about thirty-four to .. forty , somewhere in there . ... Yeah . ...

We often meditate , I think , on the love of Christ , and there are many ways to do it , ... and those who have meditated on the love of Christ , have often done so , in terms of the cross itself , have imagined again and afresh , .. uh , .. his uh bleeding wounds , uh see him as he died on the cross ,  but , nan ... wherever we turn . .. uh in .. considering the love of Christ . we turn always to the Gospel records , don't we . We we turn to the Word of God . .. We turn to the real Jesus , as he's described .  .. And uh , ... There- .. there is where .. our .. meditation always centers . (COUGH) (COUGH) That .. we might know him , and uh see the wonder of his love . ... And not only hear him as he cries , why have you forsaken me , but uh , see him also , in his .. seeking love , as the risen Lord . ...

Not the first time he'd seen him , he made a special resurrection appearance , uh .. to Peter . ... But uh , there in the morning , early morning , in the Lake of Galilee . ... And there are cocks crowing in the distance . ... And Jesus says to Peter , ... do you love me , more than these ? ... Simon , .. son of Jonah , .. do you love me , .. more than these . ... Three times the question . ... Because , you see , ... as uh ... we were saying a bit ago  , .. the love and the service go together . Don't they .   If Peter is to be restored in service , ... he has to be restored in love . ... And when .. Peter says , uh , I love you , then Jesus says , .. uh , ... feed my sheep , .. tend my lambs , .. care for my little ones . ... We -- .. we can't love others , .. in the name of Christ , ... unless .. the love for others is a .. overflow , .. of our love .. for the Lord himself . ... The people that we're called to love , are .. unfortunately , .. .. not , .. uh , .. warrantably lovable . ... We uh , .. The source of our love , .. is .. not how appealing they are , ... although , we can praise God for his image in them , and rejoice in the many evidences of God's common grace in their lives , .. but , nevertheless , ... uh basically , the .. the fountain of our love , i- is uh , .. the seeking love of the savior . ... The self-denying love . ... That is uh willing to serve .. in his name . .. Do you love me . ... ... You know , nan Jesus didn't ask Peter those questions , ... to ... undercut .. his .. love , ... or his faith . ... He asked those questions .. to establish it . ... And uh Jesus does the same with you , my friend , ... he does the same . ... He does ask you , this morning , .. do you love me . .. Do you really love me . ... But he asks it , .. in order that you'll be able to say at last with Peter , Lord , .. you know everything . You know my heart . .. And Lord you know that in spite of everything  , yes .. Lord I do love you . ...  Well , ... the saving love of uh .. the Father , and the Son , .. is also the saving love of the Spirit . .. and that's why I read that section from Romans eight . ... Uh you see , God's .. love .. is .. is present .. in the Spirit . ... ... There there's a wonderful theology of the Spirit , in uh , .. in the Scriptures . Especially of course in the New Testament , .. Um , .. Bultmann , in his uh commentary on uh Romans eight , uh , talks about , uh , the two ways .. in which the Spirit .. i- is spoken of . ... And uh , h he unfortunately uses anthropological terms to describe it , uh , he talks about uh , the the the Spirit in uh the sense of mana , .. as in uh animi , where the spirit , .. you have a spirit of of a tree , or a .. a stone , or something like that , and then you have the more personal concept of the Spirit . uh uh , both an impersonal and a personal concept of the Spirit . Now , .. I d- I don't care for his analogy , but uh the point is well taken . .. Uh , the point is that Paul does speak of the Spirit , both as possessor , and as possessed . ... You see , the Spirit possesses us . .. Uh , as Christians , .. we are not demon possessed , .. we are Holy Spirit possessed . .. And uh , .. Holy Spirit possession , has a .. close relationship to demon possession . .. uh , the close relationship is what makes it so different . .. You see , uh demon possession is always destructive , because uh Satan can't create .  And the demon-possessed man in Gadare ? Remember ? uh he couldn't even give his name . When Jesus asked him what his name was . Uh he- -- His personality was destroyed . You know how C S Lewis has done that in his uh , uh adult novels . Uh , uh but uh , there it is . nan S- emon possession is personality destructive . It depersonalizes , because uh Satan can only corrode , he can't create . He can only destroy . .. But , Holy Spirit POUND possession , is no less real possession , only , it has the opposite effect .  .. The Holy Spirit , you see , is the creator Spirit , who brought uh order out POUND of chaos , the Holy Spirit is the one who orders , the Holy Spirit is the one who frees , uh liberates , uh the- -- uh the- the- the- Gadarene demoniac thought he was free , because nobody could tie him up , you see ,  he could go anywhere , do anything , uh absolute freedom . Right ? nan and he could treat people -- he hi- he didn't have to dress any particular way , .. no dress code , and so he stripped it all off . And the he uh , he could uh d- treat people any way he wanted to , so whenever they came by , he beat them up . .. And uh , (COUGH) (COUGH)  None and uh then , if there was nobody handy to beat up , he picked up a stone , and uh tore his own flesh apart .  There's demonic liberty . But uh , Holy Spirit liberty doesn't work that way . See . Uh , .. uh now m , .. you'll accuse me of thinking uh of Holy Spirit liberty , in too strictly Presbyterian terms , .. because uh ,   I remind you , that that man , once he was delivered , was seated clothed , and in his right mind . ((LAUGHTER) Uh and ...  ...    None And we'll pass over other uh uh Scriptural accounts , (COUGH) like the lame man healed , by the Beautiful Gate at the temple , who went in leaping and dancing and praising the Lord . ((LAUGHTER) See that ,  uh that's a little different , but  (COUGH) .. (COUGH) (COUGh) But uh nan you Presbyterians want to do everything decently and in order .  Uh but , but the Holy Spirit , remember , is the spirit of both . .. Right ? He's the spirit of order , he's the spirit of ardor .  And- and the Holy Spirit , uh uh s the one , .. uh who has uh , ... ordered our lives . And as he possesses us . He orders us . And he gives us the order of love . ... If you love me , Jesus said , keep my commandments . Uh I .. wanna say a little bit more about that in a moment . The obedience of love . But the Holy Spirit is the one who orders our lives , ... uh , controls our lives , .. is in possession of our lives , but the Holy Spirit's also given to us , see , he's not only the possessor , he's also the one .. who is possessed . .. We possess him . .. He dwells in our hearts . Uh , we have not only the gifts of the Spirit , in the plural , but we have the gift of the Spirit .. We have the Holy Spirit himself , given to us . .. The promise of the Father . .. Uh they- the disciples were to wait , .. until that great promise was given , the gift of the Holy Spirit . .. And so .. the Holy Spirit given to us , uh f- -- works in us . Uh , .. that ... sense of the presence of God's love . And that's why uh Paul says , in Romans five , .. that God pours out his love in our hearts . .. By the Holy Spirit . .. Now , there , the love that's poured out , .. does not describe the love that we have for God , although that is the fruit of the Spirit you know , .. love joy peace .. so on ? Uh , but n that passage , in Romans five , Paul isn't talking about uh , the gift of love that we have for God , he's talking about the gift of love that God has for us . .. Because he goes on to describe that love of God . .. God commends his love toward us , in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us . .. So it's God's love for us , that's poured out in our hearts , by the Holy Spirit given to us . .. Which is uh , ... again . ... uh , .. a wonderful .. reality . ... .. Because , .. if God didn't do that , ... uh , we wouldn't have a love for God  . ... There's no .. spring of that divine love within us . .. It comes from him . ... And it does come from him , and he does give it . ..  .. And so the Spirit is the spirit of uh adoption . The spirit of sonship . ... Now , to be the spirit of sonship , he has to be also the spirit of fatherhood , right ? ... Uh to make us POUND aware POUND , that we are children of God , uh we have to know , .. that he is our father . And so , it is the love of God , made real to our hearts , .. the knowledge that he does love us , .. that he is present with us , that uh .. becomes of course then the source , of our .. uh .. love toward him . .. Um , ... uh friends , (COUGH) uh , .. there's -- .. there's nothing more important . ... For the whole balance , and stability , and progress , and growth , of our Christian lives . ... Than , .. to realize , again , and again , and again , the uh , .. the wonder , .. of our union with Jesus Christ . .. Through the Spirit . ... Because it's in Jesus Christ that we are united to the Father , .. and it is by the Spirit that Christ is present in our hearts , and it's by the Spirit that the Father is present in our hearts . .. Two aspects .. of union with Christ , i- I think you all know this theology , but it always pays to .. think about it again . .. The representative union , .. the vital union . .. The representative union . ... The basis of our salvation . .. When Christ died , ... we died . ... Because he died for us . ... He died as our representative , he died in our place , .. uh he died as uh , uh the one , uh who bore our sins . .. In his own body , on the tree . ... So he was our representative . .. Right ? ... And he represented us , not only as Paul teaches , .. not only when he died for us , but when he rose for us . ... And then he ascended , into the heavenly places , and where he is , we are . .. And that's why Paul says in Ephesians , that we are in the heavenly places , in Christ Jesus . .. Why . Representatively . .. Where he is , .. we are . ... Now , .. that's a tremendously , .. important of course , foundational , life-transforming truth . ... It's happened . ... See , you are a a new creature in Christ , because you're united to him . ... You have triumphed over sin and death . You have died to sin . And Paul's .. reasoning about how we ought to live , is always grounded in that . (COUGH) Uh you know , in Colossians . Uh , it's because , Christ rose , .. that we are to seek the things which are above . .. .. You are risen with Christ . Seek the things which are above . .. Because you died with Christ , therefore mortify .. sin in your members . Put to death sin , because it has died . In other words , the imperative is always grounded in the indicative . .. Because of what Christ did for us , .. therefore , uh we live out of the fact , the reality , the accomplishment , of his perfect work . And don't forget , .. Jesus not only paid the price of your sins , but remember that he lived a perfect life for you . That the white robe of righteousness , that you wear in that last day , is the robe of Christ's righteousness . So , it's all that Christ did for you . nan uh Jesus was baptized for you . Uh let it be done to fill all righteousness . .. The righteousness he had to fill for you . .. See he he did it all for you .  But then of course the other side of it is , it's not only representative , it's also vital . .. Jesus Christ is the vine , and we are the branches . Y- we're united to him . Our life is drawn from Christ . There is the uh , uh not only the the the legal uh aspect of that which Christ did for us , as our representative , there is the vital aspect , of what Christ does in us , .. as he lives in us , and dwells in us , and has fellowship with us , and and we walk with him . Uh , uh every nan uh y- y- you know , i- t's uh , it's been long fashionable in theological circles to uh , ... sniff at the hymn , uh I walked in the garden alone , while the dew was still on the roses , you know , uh all this uh romantic business , and uh , and not a shred of theology in the whole hymn , and yet everybody .. perversely seems to love it . Uh well uh , uh , I I I think , I think the reason it's so loved , in spite of its uh , uh uh theological vacuity , uh is that it's uh experientially , ((LAUGHTER) uh retty much on target .   We've all known those uh precious times of uh of genuine fellowship with the Lord , that uh , that- -- we can describe only with great difficulty .  And uh , it's TRUE , you see , uh , we are vitally united to Jesus Christ . Uh we do know him , and the knowledge that we have of him , is the knowledge of love . We just simply .. love him . ... Uh , .. we uh , ow the mystics , the Christian myth- mystics , l- love to talk about -- ... we've got some kind of time constraint here , what uh uh what- -- ((LAUGHTER) w-  w- w- when do we , I think , When -- I think we're done when you are . so  ,  well , I I gotta be -- finish what you have to say . I I well -- I'll I yeah . Let me try to finish what I'm talking about here but , but uh  , there- there- -- I don't often get chance , .. to talk to types like you , you know it's wonderful  , ((LAUGHTER)     uh it's particularly wonderful , cause I know you know everything I'm saying anywaysso , you can ile affirmatively , and that encourages me , that's great . uh but (throat) -- ((LAUGHTER) But uh , but , nan really , the- the- that uh , you know the Christian mystics .. talked about climbing Jacob's ladder . And uh , uh you you you'd .. come up the ladder , and when you get at the top , you fling yourself down , .. at the very gate of heaven . .. And maybe uh , maybe the gate will open . Y- you can't .. control it , you don't know when it will open , .. but maybe it will open . And when it opens , then , uh it's uh , light .. bursting in your inner heart . And uh , once you've had that experience , you'd .. give anything to have the experience repeated . And so uh , you go through any amount of discipline , and uh , try out different forms of discipline , and uh , you recite the Jesus prayer thousands of times with the monks of Mount Athos , and uh , and uh , sooner or later , uh you think it may happen . Uh the uh , you you may gain that experience .  .. Well now uh , you know , there are experiences of ecstasy , tha- uh , that can be induced by a transformation of consciousness , and uh , I think Christians sometimes have uh , uh mingled that uh psychological experience , uh , whether it's the left .. part or , or the right part of the brain taking over , .. or something , I don't think um , uh , the um , .. the psychologists are as sure as they once were , or even the neurologists about how some of those things happen , .. but uh , uh at any rate , uh , nan you see , (COUGH) None it isn't that we have to climb the ladder .   And uh , I'm I'm sorry that that whole episode with Jacob got misunderstood . All because uh , all because of the Hebrew preposition al . .. That uh , wasn't taken account of .  Uh that see , uh , he he stood .. uh .. upon , ... not it . ... ee , he Jacob st- saw the stairway , not a painter's ladder of course , but a , a tower of Babel type of thing , a uh , a zigarot . .. r- right ? You got a zigarot and ,  which was made for the gods to touch down at the top , and then they could come down uh , to the bottom . You know it was like a little heliport for the gods there . That was he idea . ((LAUGHTER) But but uh , th- they they'd come down , there'd be a temple at the bottom , and then uh the god could be with the people . But uh ,   uh but it it wasn't that that God -- that .. that uh Jacob saw God at the top of the ladder , up in Heaven , uh God stood uh upon him . ... Uh the the masculine uh there , the uh , v- v- v- vowel with the little dot over it , you know the  the the holem ? Uh he he he's uh , h he stood upon him . uh , which is the common Hebrew expression , and you know that's what it is , because the second time when God appeared to b- h uh j- Jacob at Bethel , uh , the same expression is used . He went up from upon him . .. See ? Uh , it's the same expression . So , God had come down the ladder . That's what we miss  . He wasn't standing up there at the top , uh he came down the ladder . And uh when he came down the ladder , he stood over Jacob , and revealed himself to Jacob . And that's why Jacob said , this is the house of God , .. this is the gate of Heaven . It was the House of God , he said , because God was in this place , and I didn't know it . .. See ,   it- it's , this is Bethel here , because here God has come to us . So God was revealing himself to Jacob , and God reveals himself to us . He comes to us . And uh , he seeks us . .. As we seek him . .. And our love is always in response to his love . And it's the assurance that your God loves you . .. that he seeks you . .. that he's with you . That he comes to you . It's this assurance , that draws you to repentance , and draws you to faith , and draws you to himself . Um , the uh , .. h , salvation is of the Lord .  And uh , it's the Lord's love , who quickens your love . Well , ... I'm not going to say , uh .. th- the rest of the things I .. I had in mind to say , But , uh I , you can fill out the talk for me , .. would you please sometime . .. the the commitment of love , the obedience of love . If you love me keep my commandments . Um , .. remember , uh Mary's adoration , .. Uh when she uh .. brought the spikenard , and uh , opened it and poured it out on the feet of Jesus , just before he went to the cross ? And Judas criticized her remember , .. Uh because , he said , this could have been given to the poor , uh , he- he- he was the first old-fashioned liberal . Don't worship Jesus , but help the poor . .. Uh , but uh , ((LAUGHTER)  Uh y- you see , uh ,   uh , w- what- what was the answer . What was the answer that Jesus uh gave . Uh , uh , n- let her do this . Let her keep it . Not in the sense of preserving the ointment , she was pouring it out , .. but in the sense of observing it . Observing a a an observance against his burial . Uh so , she realized what his death meant , and she realized who he was . He said the poor you have with you always , but me , you have not always .  A tremendous assurance of his own deity . Who else could say something like that . Hunh ?  But Jesus said it , and uh , ... uh you see what that says to us . ... Uh , ... if our Lord were here , .. then we could pour out perfume on his feet . .. He's not here . ... But who is . .. The poor .. you have with you always . ... So whose feet can we anoint . The feet of the poor , .. in his name . ... See . ... Uh , ... love .. uh uh doesn't mean , nan ... h climbing up .. Jacob's ladder .. to the heavenlies , ... where nobody else can be around .  The love of God is experienced in the community of the saints , ... it's experienced as we all reached out . .. reach out . to the breadth , and the length , and the height , and the depth , and the love of God is experienced , in the course of service . ... A- I heard you describe some of these service projects , that uh , um .. Intervarsity is involved in , and friends , um , .. these  these projects , .. even if uh ... they're working about rebuilding old houses , or whatever  , ... they are not things nan that have nothing to do with love . ... They are works of love . ... They are .. the evidence , ... of that .. love of God , .. in our hearts . Uh they are the fruit , .. that is borne , by the tree , .. that has the roots down into the water of God's refreshing grace and love . .. .. And uh , .. the mystical heights of Christian devotion , .. ought never to be separated .. from .. the realities , of uh .. Christian .. service . ... The uh , ... there was a hymn .. in the old InterVarsity hymnal , it's not in the new one , by   a hymn that I .. love v- very much . Talks about how we go with Jesus through the desert , and through uh , the sufferings , and the trials of this life . .. And uh , .. its very last verse is uh , he who in his hour of sorrow , .. bore the curse alone , I who through the lonely desert , trod .. where he had gone . ... He and I , .. in that .. bright glory , (COUGH) .. one deep joy .. shall .. share . ... Mine , .. to be .. forever with him . ... His , ... that .. I am there . ... My friends , ... in the wonder of God's love . ... He's pleased with you . ... God who looked at his own Son , .. and his heart rejoiced . ... His heart rejoices this morning . .. In your praise . ... In your worship . .. In the service of your hands . ... In the love of your heart . ... Shall we pray . ... Our heavenly Father , ... we ... cannot find words to express our love for you , ... because we are overwhelmed by your love for us . ... Lord Jesus , ... how may we speak to you , ... of that .. which you give to us . ... Spirit of God , ... how we praise you , ... that when we do not know what to pray as we should , ... you make intercession for us , with groanings that cannot be uttered . ... And o Lord , ... receive we pray ... this morning , ... the incense of our love for you , ... and forbid Lord , ... that this should be just a passing emotion in our hearts , ... uh burn it upon the deepest .. recesses of our being . ... Make us Lord your servants . .. Your servants in love . ... We ask it in Jesus's name , .. amen . ... Doctor Mosely thank you ,  .. for Yeah . coming and speaking to us . Nyeah . APPLAUSE Come on Walter . ... amen Walter . Walt , Amen Walt , Walt , good job CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP Woo . Good morning . (CHEERS_WHISTLES_APPLAUSE) Amen . ...

Help me to drink the cups . and thank you Brian , (COUGH) for reminding us through God's word of the cups , amen . Yep .  uh that we do need to drink . that was really great . thanks . .. a couple of announcements , before we go ahead and uh get started here on the sermon , Number one is , uh , those of you who took those medical forms , for the Hope Clinic , .. downtown Boston , the medical clinic , we need to turn those in , ... today . ..

Being our friend , ... our support , .. our courage , ... and our life . ... It's in the name of Jesus , ... your Son , ... our brother , ... we pray . ... Amen . Amen . ... ... Mark chapter five . ... I'm gonna start over there . ... Hey have you ever been afraid of anything .  You know I remember some things I was afraid of . ... All of us have been afraid of something , haven't we ? ... Or somebody ? ... Yeah ,  You know I remember uh , when I was a kid . ... And uh , maybe Paul'll remember this . But , we uh , we had this one -- .. we lived in a a all cottage , in back of a three-tenement house . ... on uh Prospect Street in Lynne . ... number twentyeight . ... You remember that Paul ? ..  And uh ,  (COUGH)  it was ,  it was kind of a all house upstairs , it had uh , .. one large bedroom , ... actually two large bedrooms , which my mom and dad slept in , and the other bedroom , uh , it was all us five boys , in that one bedroom ,  .. with two beds . ...  Whoa . You know , ... And my sister ,  (COUGH)  had her own room , .. cause she's the only girl .  .. But it was a little aller .  So we had , uh ,   we had this one big bedroom , and there was two beds in the room , so that meant , .. three of us slept in one bed , and two of us slept in the other bed . ... And uh , I remember those days , I remember those days , .. h , being with those guys , trying to get the covers , and many days I woke up with no covers , you know what I mean ? ..   And one of my brothers wet the bed , so , I mean , it was like , ((LAUGHTER) Ugh . ugh .  One of those days you woke up cold , .. and a little damp . You know ? ((LAUGHTER) Oh . MURMUR That's kind of gross , isn't it .  Well that's how I grew up . But in this bedroom , MURMUR um , ... Maybe that's why I turned out this way , I don't know . Just kind of crazy . ((LAUGHTER) You know ? From a young age , I guess . ... But in that , in that , .. uh , bedroom , ... was a closet . ... Yep . Well , Paul's saying , oh yeah , I remember that closet . You know .   And this closet was there . And it was this .. incredible closet . ..  And uh , (COUGH) .. Every night before I .. went to bed , I wanted to make sure , ... that closet door , ... was closed . Oh yeah . ((LAUGHTER)  Cause I knew , if that closet door was open , (COUGH) (COUGH) I wasn't gonna sleep . ...   Cause inside that closet , ..  there was a nasty old boogyman . ((LAUGHTER)  Right Paul ?  And I was afraid of that boogyman ,   .. You know , during the day , I'd go in there , and look around , and see if I could find him . ... And I'd be amidst the shoes , and all the junk and stuff in there , and he wasn't there , but at night , ... that's where his home was .  None And I was scared of that . .. Yeah ,  ... Were you afraid of him Paul , as well , I don't know .  ... Were you afraid of that closet ? ...  Yeah he was too . (LAUGHTER_CHEERS_APPLAUSE) so , I'd never asked him that before , so , ... ((LAUGHTER) I'll have to ask my other brothers as well . ... You know , I remember some other things I was afraid of , I remember , at times , uh , we grew up in a navyh- neighborhood that was multiracial . ... And uh , (COUGH) Some of us didn't get along . ... And it was always interesting , that .. when you , .. got into trouble , .. you ended up .. dealing with a number of .. kids , .. besides just one . ... So I know of several times , I had an , .. uh , a kid that was after me , ... and uh , he would bring all his friends , and there'd be about ten kids waiting for me . .. After school . .. .. Cause I went to a different school than they went to , and they got out earlier than we did . .. Uhoh .   So it's kinda like , None uhoh . M ,  There they are . what am I gonna do . And they can't come in the schoolyard . You know ? .. Cause the adults'll put em out . But they're out there waiting , saying we're gonna get you Walt . .. we're gonna get you .  you know ? We're after you , and ,  and uh , and what I would do is , .. go all the way around . LAUGHTER ... Jumping fences , going through yards , you know , None .. ducking down behind cars None , LAUGHTER  so those guys couldn't get me .  cause I was afraid , I knew what was gonna happen .  Those guys were gonna beat the tar out of me . It's a good reason to be afraid , Isn't it ? I think so . ... art -- Throwing rocks at you , and .. things like that . ...  But anyway , there was a time that eventually , ...  eventually ,  I couldn't run , ... eventually I had to deal with my fear , .. and confront None ... Yep , None those people . ... I still did get the ... daylights beat out of me . ... And uh ,  But I confronted my fear . ...  You know I wanna talk a little bit about fear today , ...   Uh ,  cause I believe it's something that keeps us , ... (%) .. from doing everything we can do , as .. human beings , ... the potential that God has given us , ... and I believe it also , ... really keeps us from , (SNEEZE) ... a , ... strong spiritual .. walk with God . (MURMUR_AGREEMENT) (SNEEZE) .. Let's open to Mark chapter uh , ... five , ... verse thirtyfive . ... That day when evening came , he said to his disciples , ... Let us go over to the other side . ... Leaving the crowds behind , they took him along , .. just as he was . ... In the boat . ... There were also other boats with him . ... A furious squall came up , and the waves broke over the boat , so that it was nearly swamped . ... Jesus was in the stern . Sleeping on a cushion . ... Hey . .. Man . ... The disciples woke him and said to him , teacher . ... Don't you care if we drown ? ... He got up , ... rebuked the wind , ... and said to the waves , ... Quiet . ... Be still . ... Then the wind died down , and it was completely calm . ... He said to his disciples , Why are you so afraid . ... Do you still have no faith ? .. .. They were terrified , speaker label was originally READ None changed None Kevin Schfer and asked each other , ... Who is this . ... Even the wind and the waves , ... obey him . ... Let's go on . .. Well they went across the lake to the region of Geras- -- uh .. Gerasenes , ... when Jesus got out of the boat , a man with an evil spirit , .. came from the tombs to meet him . ... I don't think he walked up and shook his hand , we're gonna see that in a second .  This man lived in the tombs , and no one could bind him anymore , not even with a chain . (COUGH) ... For he had often been chained , hand and foot . ... But he tore the chains apart , and broke the irons on his feet . ... No one was strong enough to subdue him . ... Night and day among the tombs and in the hills , he would cry out and cut himself , with stones . ... When he saw Jesus from a distance , He ran and fell on his knees in front of him . ... He shouted at the top of his voice . ... What do you want with me Jesus . Son of the Most High God . ... Swear to God that you won't torture me . ... for Jesus had said to him , Come out of this man , you evil spirit . ... Then Jesus asked him , What is your name . ... My name is legion , he replied , for we are many . ... And he begged Jesus again and again , not to send them out into the area . ... A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside . The demons begged Jesus , .. send us among the pigs , allow us to go into them . ... He gave them permission , and the evil spirits , came out and went into the pigs . aa The herd about two thousand in number , rushed down the steep bank into the lake , .. and were drowned . ... Those tending the pigs ran off , and reported this in the town , and countryside . And the people went out to see what had happened . ... When they came to Jesus , They saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons . Sitting there , .. dressed in his right mind . ... And they were afraid . ... Those who had seen it told the people what had happened , ... T- what had happened to the demon-possessed man , and he told about the pigs , ... as well . ... Then the people began to plead with Jesus , to leave their region . ... and I'm gonna stop right there . ... You know , as we look at this we see that , the disciples were afraid . They were terrified . ... Of what had happened in the boat . ... You know what it's like to be terrified ? ... Have you ever been terrified . (COUGH) .. I mean that's a pretty scary thing . Isn't it ? Being terrified is a very very scary word . especially if you've experienced it . .. Maybe you were in a car wreck one time . I was in a car wreck coming back from Indianapolis one time , we were going sixty miles an hour , and we're going down the freeway , and all of a sudden this woman pulls out of the ramp , trailor truck hits his brakes , he s- -- he's -- he's behind us , I thought he's coming through us , another person ashes us , we're spinning around the highway , glass is flying everywhere , and I'm saying Lord take me quickly . ... I was scared to death , I was terrified . We ended up in the middle of the median , ... h , .. and , .. I had to crawl out through a window , to get out of the car . ... I was terrified . ... I know that feeling . That's .. what the disciples were feeling at that time , they were terrified . They didn't understand . What was going on . .. And then we see the demon-possessed man . ... He was um , really , ... think about .. how possessed he really was . He was strong enough to break irons . .. Yep . on his wrists , and to free himself from the shackles , that were on his feet . And he cried out in the evening , and cut himself with stones . .. I mean he was a pretty wild guy , wasn't he . Yep . ((MURMUR) But Jesus took good care of him . ...  He gave him back ... his sanity . Amen . .. He gave him back ... his mind . Yep . ... And the people .. came out to see what had happened , cause they heard about the pigs ,  And they came out it says , they were afraid too . ... They were afraid . Just like the disciples were afraid . ... They were afraid , ... and they asked Jesus , ... to leave , ... the region . ... You know it's amazing but , ... that fear . ... because they didn't understand . ... And they wanted to control . ... the situation . ... You know fear is o ... crippling . ...  .. I mean it just knocks on our door , every single day . Every single day we get up , it knocks on our door . ... Amen . .. We all have different fears . it kind of pulls us in , it entraps us . .. It keeps us from moving . We become immobile . ... And that truly is , what was happening , to the people . .. Their response was , no thi- -- ... this is incredible . This is the son of God . Look at the great miracle that he's performed . He's given this man peace . He's given this man sanity . He's given this man life again . ... And we're grateful to you Jesus . We're happy Jesus . We're excited about what you're doing here . please stay with us , forever . we'll feed you , we'll take care of you . We'll become your friends . We'll sit at your feet . We'll pray with you we'll learn from you . ... . ... wrong . ... Jesus , ... you just need to leave our region . ... Cause they were afraid . .. Mhm . .. Because they didn't understand . ... And they were no longer in control . ... But Jesus , ... was in control . ... ... They realized , that what Jesus had done , ... no other man , ... could possibly do . ... That there was something different ... about Jesus . .. That's right . .. But their fear ... kept them ... from finding out ... exactly ... who Jesus was . Does your fear keep you ... from knowing exactly ... who Jesus ... is . .. Does your fear keep you from a radical relationship ... with God . .. Does it keep you from a personal relationship .. with God . (COUGH) (COUGH) More than just going to church on Sunday , going to a mid-week service , or , even going to Bible talks . ... Or group discussions . ... Or one-on-one study . Does your fear keep you from that radical personal relationship with God . ..  Does your fear keep you from , deep personal relationships ... with one another . ... You know the world is an interesting place . ... We all ... crave that . .. Don't we ? as human beings , a personal relationship , we're looking for personal relationships , we're looking for friendship . Aren't we ? ... You know , C- uh , Craig was uh , ... uh Greg was -- ... I always get those two mixed up . Greg and Craig . ... You look so much arike like yeah None . ((LAUGHTER) Greg was sharing something with me , that , last Sunday , when we were in the middle of the snow storm , he decided , and the g- and and the and the brothers in ... that apartment , they were gonna go out and knock on all the doors , in their apartment , invite people to come to the worship service , cause no one could get out . they were all snowed in . ... So he went around the building , knocking on doors , which f- .. in itself is crazy . Right ? .. .. Yeah , it is . It's crazy . I mean , you know . ... How many times have you done that in your life . ... mit's crazy . ... It's out of the -- out of the ordinary . ... Maybe a little bit insane . But anyway , they went around , knocking on doors , inviting people to come down , he said it was amazing , I could hear people there , but they wouldn't come to the door . ... And then there were others he knocked on , the people would come to the door , they would talk , but they wouldn't open the door . ... Then there were others , who opened the door just a little bit . ... (COUGH) None Just t- -- ... to see who was there . you know None ? ((LAUGHTER) Or you look out that peep hole . let me just see- , the hole's about this big ,  None and you stick your , you know , you're looking like this None , ((LAUGHTER) Right ? Oh Lord . And then there were others , .. who opened their door , ... and went to the service , .. and it changed their lives . Amen . But fear , keeps us from those personal relationships , with one another . ... We're so concerned about , what everybody else thinks . Yep . about us . That's right . ((MURMUR) Doesn't that cripple you ? Yeah , ... What's someone gonna think , if they find out I'm a Christian . ... What is someone gonna think , when I tell em I'm a disciple . ... That I don't do these things anymore . ... Jeez , what are they gonna think , if I invite them , ... to learn about Jesus . ... And to study the Bible . ... See we're so concerned , we're afraid , we're fearful , and that fear robs us , .. of that deep .. personal relationship with God , and that deep personal relationship .. with one another . ... We all experience it . ... It keeps us , ... fear keeps us .. from changing our lives . .. Preach it Walter  Fear .. keeps us ... from changing ... the world . AGREEMENT ... needed to overcome their fears . ... In order that they might have that radical relationship with God . ... The disciples needed to overcome their fears , in order to have a deep personal relationship with one another . ... The disciples , needed to overcome , .. their fears , ... in order to , .. change their lives . ... The disciples , needed to overcome their fears , in order to change the world . That's right . And if we go back and we examine the Gospels , Amen . we see , very clearly , that all the time that Jesus spent with them , they were afraid . Peter was afraid . Thomas was afraid . They were many many times afraid . But they -- .. they understood , the only way they would overcome their fear , .. would be , through Jesus Christ . And his example . Because the Lord had many challenging times , in his life . Where fair -- .. Where fear , ... could be the dominant factor . ... That could take away , his relationship , ... with God . ... Amen . I mean think about it . ... You know I was uh , ... thinking about fear . ... And I guess that , what prompted me about this , is cause I'm fearful person . ... (COUGH) You say oh , well you're getting up here and speak in front of , ... two or three hundred people , and you know , you've done this , and you've done that , and you've done this , and I'm like , Well , ... Yeah , amen . But I'm still a fearful person . ... ... But I really wanna overcome my fears . (MURMUR_AGREEMENT) I wanna get , amen . ... deeper and deeper with the Lord , ... I wanna get deeper and deeper with you , .. I wanna get d -- I wanna be able to change my life , ... and I wanna be able to change the world . .. (MURMUR_AGREEMENT) You know I've had the opportunity , to r- to- to- just really go back , and read some things , outside of the Bible , uh on Martin Luther King Junior . .. Cause the guy blows my mind . ... He blows my -- here's a man who died , .. for what he believed . ... He died ... to see ... justice . ... equality . ... peace . ... He died for that . ... And I'm thinking , ... He is willing to drink that cup . He was afraid many times , but he pushed through his fears . ... In order .. to ... succeed and have victory . ... For himself , ... and for the people , ... that were around him . ... The Black nation of America . ... You know we need to learn , number one , if we are gonna overcome our fears , .. The first point is to face ... our fears . In order to overcome our fears , we must face our fears . .. Amen . That's right .  I w- -- Amen . I had the opportunity , as you know , .. to spend a lot of time with my brother , he's moved in with us , .. and just to talk . ... And and as we were talking , what came out , is really , his fears . ... What he was .. afraid of . ... In becoming ... a disciple . ... In becoming a Christian . ... And it brought me back , .. to the time when I was studying the Bible . ... And I remember all of the fears that were in my life . ... in c- in in .. making a decision , to follow Christ . ... You know I can remember the fear of , they all wanna take my money . ... ((LAUGHTER) That was a fear for me . That was real . ... I worked hard for my money .  I was concerned about this , POUND cultic organization , trying to take my money POUND . ... You know , I'd look at the checkbook . ... My wife would write a check for ten dollars , I'd go crazy . Cause I was afraid . .. They would take my money . ... Right Paul ? ... Yeah . Sure . ..   I was afraid I was gonna lose my personality . ... as you can see , ((LAUGHTER) I've not lost it . ((LAUGHTER) Amen . Amen . It's been matured . ((MURMUR) Yeah . thats , yeah . Amen . I was afraid I was gonna lose my identity . ... Well as you can see ,   Still got one  . Amen . .. Maybe it needs to change some , but I still have it . ... I was afraid that , I'd be robbed of my individuality . ... I'd be robbed of my independence and my free will . ... Well let me tell you , ... I'm plenty independent .  Uhoh . ... And I have f- a free will to choose and pick , ... what I want to do with my life . But what I've chose , ... is to overcome my fears , ... and give my life , ... to Jesus Christ . Amen . But we must face our fears . Ask yourselves , ... why are you afraid . ... Think about your own fears . Think about your own personal fears , inside your life . The deep ones . Not the outside ones about money and stuff .  But the deep deep truths in your heart . Cause each one of us , have some things in our life , that we're very fearful about . .. Ask yourself , Why .. am I afraid . ... See we need to ask ourselves that question , every single day . We need to ask ourselves that question , every single time , it comes up . Because in that way , .. confronting our fears , It will give us , a measure of success . It will give us a measure of power . It doesn't mean we've done it yet , but when we bring it up , it will give us a measure of that power . It will give us a measure of success . (COUGH) (COUGH)  Not the total victory , but a all measure to understand , where we're really at . Yeah . Amen . ... You know , .. the thing about fears . ... The more we attempt to ignore or repress them , ... the more ... we multiply ... the conflict inside . Wow . That's right . Isn't that TRUE . ... You know when you're afraid to deal with something , and you're afraid ? ... and then all of a sudden , it starts multiplying . (BBBB) And now you're really afraid . Right ? And now you don't want to say anything to any about anything . Right ? Cause it's started to multiply . And the longer that fear goes , .. the more it multiplies . till it gets to the point where it .. totally immobilizes you . .. Right .  Till you become , totally , unable to move . ... You become stymied . ... Mm . ... Still . ... And we know as human beings , .. just like nature , ... if we're not growing , ... we're dying . And that fear , .. starts to eat .. away , ... at you . ... You know the great thing about bringing your fears up too . ... Is that when you bring your fears up , ... what we find out many times , ... is that they're more imaginary , ... than they are real . Yes . Isn't that TRUE . It's like , ... I need to talk to Windham , ... about this . ... It's like , oh , I don't know if I wanna talk to Windham about this . And then I start , Then this fear start to multiply . (BBBB)  ((LAUGHTER) You know what I mean ? Yeah None Then I don't wanna talk None . ... Right . .. Then nan -- then I go and talk , oh he's gonna say this and , he's gonna say that and , he's gonna be in my face and , da-na-da-na-da-na-da-na . ... And I'm like , ... and then I go and I talk to him . I muster up -- ... which is m- our second point , which is courage . Amen . I muster up the courage , and I talk to Windham . And you know what , I'm like , wow . ... That isn't anything like I thought . Isn't that TRUE . And I feel so much better , I'm like , I can't believe I did that . What a dummy . .. What a fool . ...  ... that I would think those things . See because a lot of times our fears , ... really are , ... imaginary . ... See , fear , really involves the misuse ... of our imagination . ... Yeah that's right . Mm . ... You know when you're talking about being a disciple , and you hear these incredibly hard sermons . ... And I do preach a few hard sermons . Amen . Today's not one of those real hard ones , .. No ? .. I thought I'd give you a break . ((LAUGHTER) Thanks bro . Maybe I needed a break  . I've had a few this week . .. But really , it's TRUE , I mean , we- we- and you hear these incredibly hard sermons , well what do they mean about this . and what do they mean about that . Oh ho ha oh ha . I mean I do that . I used to hear Kip preach in the opera house , Woohoo . and I'd be like , Oh . Who is this man . ... Oh I can't believe he said that . ((LAUGHTER) And I'd go there , even before we even got there , I'd be sharing -- we'd go , we'd be with Laurie , and I'd invite someone to come to church with me , and they would come , and I'd say , Boy , I hope he doesn't preach this and , I hope he doesn't preach that and , ((LAUGHTER) None I hope he doesn't say this and , I hope he doesn't say that . You ever felt that way ? (MURMUR_AGREEMENT) See and we- -- all of a sudden the fear starts . ... (BBBB) .. ((LAUGHTER) you know what I mean ? and it totally , our imagination runs wild . ... See um , fear , is really , the misuse .. of our imagination . to focus on the negative , Wow . ... as opposed to the positive . ... You could use that imagination , ... in a great positive way , ... to give you courage . ... And that's really my second point , to overcome fears , .. we really need to , ... be able to , ... have courage . ... Look it at ... first John chapter four . ... Actually , I do- I don't wanna leave this first point , till I make this , ... this point within the point . . ... nan You know it's , .. it was really pretty straightforward this morning .  ... .. And , ... y- z- -- ... I thought you did a good job all the way through . ... I mean you were on top of what you were scanning , Hm . Thanks . ... um , .. should've kept that one Horizon , Fauker jet . just t- keep em on the right . ... Why did you switch em . Well , ... ... looking at something , I would get -- it didn't seem like I could get someone else out . ... But , um , ... and , .. part of it to provide a good service , but then , ... Yeah . ... Well , that- that- -- I guess that's one reason the two eight's kind of -- ... well , two eight's kinda nice sometimes , because , ... nan .. I mean when we're on ten , all the departures seemed like they're going out the left . (SNIFF) so you really want your arrivals on the right . .. When you're landing two eight , .. then you can .. get departures off of , almost both at any time . (SNIFF) So you always got a hole . Nyeah . .. Yeah . .. So , ... but uh , don't feel bad about keeping Horizon on the right , boy , because , Mhm . ... sure doesn't hurt them to taxi any . They're so used to having , ... A number one service ,    Yeah . plus when they're departingg , every one of em came -- 2.. they're right by the gate . Everyone- -- even , .. even one or- -- one or two of em I said , I'll advise if the left becomes available . and they said w , and they -- they still ask . .. we'd like the left , if it becomes available   .   I know , they still ask . (SNIFF) And Viking is the same way . ..  Yeah . ... So . ... There's sh -- there's sure nothing wrong with keeping em on the right though . ... Um , ... Traffic Watch Eight we discussed , So radar service terminated , um , call me inbound , ... or , .. You wanna say radar service terminated , frequency change approved . .. Report back inbound . ... Or , ... I I think that something a little ttle .. more like that's better , than just saying radar service terminated , because , he's kinda -- ... Left hanging . Okay . .. And you could just say , ... radar service terminated , report back inbound , and then he'll -- ... he'll either come back and say , well I'm departing the area , now back to Hillsborrow , Or I'll call you back inbound . So that gives you an idea . .. Okay . ... But uh , ... and uh , .. ... nan Along with that , ... Let TC , .. do more of the work for you . .. Okay . ... you know , ... Um , .. just tell her what you want her to do . ... I was thinking of a .. couple ... instances , where you could've used her more than you did . ... Okay . I was thinking that for my rundowns , ... you know that would nan , .. that's -- ... that would have been a help , but , on the other s- the other hand , ... I wanna get it on tape , heck of a job Lance .       Oh thank you very much . .. Did you hear that ? ..   um ,    The problem with doing rundowns , is that it's kind of over in your face . .. Yeah .. Yeah . So , Cause the D-light kind of , .. pretty far over to the left there , but sh- you can , you can have her do it if you want . .. Um , I would -- ... I'm .. just .. working at , ... doing as much .. of these other things as I possibly can , ... Because they'll be times when I won't have a TC , and just -- ... just ... challenging myself . And that's okay .   Um , what were some of the things , other than -- what- what were some of the things that , that I should have used her for that I didn't .  Depending on who your -- (SNIFF) Who your TC is , if c- certain people sit down there , they d- -- they have a tendency to do everything for you . And sometimes that is p- -- that is really pretty nice . If you just , .. if you just , .. all you have to do is stand up , ... and look out the window , and look at the bright . .. and talk . ... nan You- no other w- -- no other coordination , or , .. or ARTS functions , or anything , That really is nice .  That's ideal . ... It it really helps . Mhm . ... the situation . .. Mhm . .. So , ... but , ... nan Right now , like you say , maybe it is better for you to do some of that stuff . (SNIFF) .. um , ... I don't think there was , I mean I had , ... just a couple that I switched to the left , you know maybe three or so , that I switched to the left , uh p- -- .. uh probably two or three , .. and so there was that , I didn't have any ... ARTS entries , I had , ... you know , Traffic Watch to slue out to , um , .. Yeah . For the most part , ... I mean I was able to k- -- I think I was able to keep up with that stuff , With the ARTS . .. Yeah . I mean ,  there wasn't really nothing much to do .  um , No , there wasn't . ... So , .. But there could be . .. Yeah . If there's VFRs departing , or , .. Yeah . I told her .. to do my ... VFR guys . .. h Yeah . And um , to write down my VFRs .   That's one thing I gotta kick myself to do . ... Yeah . ... Now are we still required to w- -- write , like , the Empires that coming in through the gates VFR ? .. Don't they ? .. We are ? ... Any VFR .  Now isn't that , ... aren't they when they c- -- ... But what if they've -- ... c- well I guess we have no way of knowing if they've come in IFR , and then cancelled VFR . ... Well yeah , because they have a strip on it downstairs . Mhm . So . ... I don't -- nan actually , I'm like you , I don't really know what the point is of that . ... Because we do have a record of em anyway . ... But , Mhm . ... when the -- when the -- ... order came across or whatever , or this memorandum that said , to write down all VFR arrivals . ... Okay . .. So , if they're a VFR arrival , you're supposed to write it down . ... Okay . ... I'll do that then . Unhunh . .. When Horizon one-thirty-eight didn't answer you there ? ... ... Go back to ground ? ... Yeah . or just move on to something else . .. I mean you tried him a couple times . You say Horizon onethirtyeight ,  , ... if they don't get the hint , if he's -- ... but if you can't get him , ... just go on . and do something else that you can do . .. United was calling ready to go . .. Yeah . So , shoot . ... just let United go . ... Horizon , Yeah , you can't do nothing with him , so just have him hold there . ... So just go on to the next . Okay . ... Next thing , and do tell ground . ... He might be still on ground frequency , which is -- (SNIFF) ... uh , .. usually not too likely , because , ... you know , At that point . At that point , well he's out there , you know , He's -- and he's probably sitting there , (SNIFF) and th- he's not hearing anything , ... .. from the tower you know , Yeah , he's probably , ... looking at his radio about then , .. .. ... Yeah , I think I was a little bit rigid in my planning of that , cause I wanted to -- had to plan , ... to get him out at that point . ... and , .. I should've been more flexible and , ... But uh , you know , .. everything else I saw , .. you- your separation was , .. was really good this morning . I mean you really tightened em up . .. Maybe a couple times almost a little bit too tight . a little to tight  .  (SNORT)   None  Cause uh , -- ... I don't know , y- a couple times you had , like one just barely at departure end , a jet at departure , and you cleared another jet for takeoff . .. And it worked out great .  Oh . ... One guy out the right and then -- oh th- -- both guys out the left . Both guys out to the left . (SNIFF) .. And it worked out good , but , ... I think it worked out because , ... this guy , was real slow , on .. on .. starting his departure roll . .. .. You know , Mhm . usually you gotta get em just a little bit off the departure end . ... before you clear the next guy . And watch out for the uh , .. the seventhirtyseven , ... fourhundreds , Fourhundreds , ... Okay . Or three and ,  Okay . ... Because uh nan , ... they'll really climb . And they can go fast , too . .. Okay . ... So , .. well you know , just take into consideration the type of aircrafts . It takes the seven-twenty-seven a little b- while to get wound up , while the seven-thirty-seven really go . ... But uh , .. -- I mean it was really good . ... Good departure separation . ... Thanks . .. I was impressed . ... And , you saw , a little bit about the twosixty ? ... Heading ? Listen to the readbacks for -- Yeah . .. ... If I know he's at twothirty . ... But you can wrap em around , to one-thirty or onesixty , to avoid the MBA , and that works great , because , otherwise you got twosixty ? There was that one time you had -- ... two south plan aircraft , and one ... westbound- -- or , river , metro and , Mhm .  Mhm . ... I d- -- I actually didn't think , ... you were gonna have three miles between the two first , ... Mhm . south plan air lane , but you did . ... That was perfect . ... The one that I kept on runway heading for a bit ? Yeah . or , .. Yeah . Okay . ... And that was good , .. it was real good planning , to keep that one Caravan on runway heading , when you had the other one going twosixty ? ... To ensure that you had , ... oh and you had the one going twoforty . .. or something ,  and then you had the Metro going s -- .. going twosixty . ... Yeah . But you kept the Metro on , this runway heading . ... Which is really good planning . ... So , ... I'm -- ... I'm -- ... less and less ... impacted . .. For lack of a better word . ... by , ... these g- -- for some reason , with all these , .. um , .. I think , ... the bulk of .. my planning , ... seems to revolve around these little guys , .. when I can turn em , fitting em in with all my other guys , for some reason , I mean y , and that is , ... you know , .. those guys , ... having a very fec- affective part , .. in the whole fan , .. of all our departures . ... And um , .. Hm . .. I think they're , ... they're a- .. affecting me less than they did in the past . .. Yeah . Does that make sense ? Yeah .  Do you know what I mean  ? Um , ... cause i- -- there was a time where , .. I mean that sequence was good too . but there was a time when , ... yeah an nan -- it it may happen again . .. Yeah . Who knows -- where I've got , .. the little West Coasts in here , and all these guys off the right and left , ... where am I actually gonna fit these guys in , and they're all calling , they're ready way early . ... And , ... Well the sequence , uh , can't be too bad . .. When you got -- when you can feed from charley ,   and from bravo , and from alpha . ... You know nan , the sequence can't be too bad , I mean all he did , You got something you can do . Yeah . ... All he did is send em all out . I mean you got all the West Coasts in the row over on charley ,  you got the jets in a row on bravo , and you got n- various things over here . So , .. you can pick and choose . ... You know , .. y- -- I mean as a ground control , you can just send em all out there , and then , when they get there , then you can start arranging the strips .    You know , the way you want , almost . Yeah .  .. You know th , that's , Yeah . that , it works great . ... That way . Because you don't have to sequence em at some other point , in their taxi route , you know , Yeah . ... They're b- -- .. they -- .. e -- .. essentially on their own ... taxiway , up through -- up to the .. approach end . .. So , ... So that was about all . ... that I -- ... you know , that I had . I mean , I was paying pretty close attention there , and I didn't .. really see much of a problem . ... Oh . Thanks . No significant problems . ...  ... to talk about . ... I'm glad . See there was , ... S- -- .. Oh um , .. don't always , nan ... um , ... don't insist on always saying , ... seven hundred . If you say -- ... Oh , Why hadn't you -- at some point after he is leaving seven , just wait till he is leaving seven hundred you mean ? Sometimes you can do that . Yeah . Yeah . There was a couple times , you didn't need to say it when , .. when you did . It was out in the -- yeah . Yeah . .. Well I mean y- w- -- Could've either waited just a bit , it was at -- He was at a five climb and , Or , he was a- -- ... just go ahead and say , turn left heading one six zero . ... Okay . Or turn left heading two six zero . For a Metro . I mean if you leave em on runway heading , for a little bit , Mhm . they're gonna be at the altitude you need so , ... but that's no big deal . ... And uh , I was watching Jet Speed come in , ... and you got Delta out in front of Jet Speed . .. Mhm . ... It seemed like you were a little tense with that but , really pay attention to the speeds when they're coming in . He was doing a hundred and twenty outside of Laker there . ... Did you see that ? Yeah . .. Yeah . .. So that -- .. that worked out great . I wondered if you'd saw- -- Yeah . I mean there was lots of room . ... Lots of time . Mhm . He wasn't , he z- wasn't flying as a normal , Mhm . .. For some reason , he just used the -- Mhm . Or is it uh , Exec Jet . ... One of those guys is usually really fast . .. Jet Speed is th- I know fast on the pr- departure , AMFlight . it seems . .. Yeah . ... I think . .. It .. seems like that was the one , but , yeah AMFlight , when they fly the later jet . Um , yeah . And I think I might have said for delta niners or to , no delay , or something like that and , Yeah . I think you did .  ... And he was actually floating at -- the Jet Speed wasn't -- ... yeah . Yeah , you had a lot of time . Yeah . ... When the Twins ... get airborne , you got a jet following  , the twin- twin's gonna go southwestbound ? ... If you got six-thousand feet , and the twin's climbing out of four or five hundred , ... you can start your tranission , then to the , .. to the jet . .. Okay . Twin Cesna ahead is , will be turning southwestbound , ... momentarily , runway two eight left clear for takeoff . It says in sight , .. .. Just didn't wanna be sure he gets his turn in ? .. Mhm . ..  Okay . The Caravan's coming across , ... if you wanna get -- Yeah what do you say . Cause I've heard different phraseology , and I af- .. feel like I was stumbling over that , I think I said it , .. couple different ways . ... A mile west , or something -- I I just say , ... nan you know on a day like this , it's so easy to see em , I would just say the Caravan ahead , ... is southwestbound . .. Runway two eight left , clear for takeoff . ... And and they'll , .. a lot of times they'll say uh in sight . ... If they don't say in sight , ... they'll say , ... nan they'll , I would assume they have em in sight , because they won't go . ... Mhm . Unless they seem em . I mean that's important to them , to see the traffic . ... but it's safe , it's a safe operation . Because , ... ne thing , you could do , is is turn the .. Caravan to twoforty . ... Mhm . To get him across . And then , ... just before you ship em , send em back to two-fifty  something like that . ... Hm .  ... Cause the track's what im- .. what's important . ... But , .. but two-fifty was working out fine today . ... Fifteen degrees and a mile . ... Is what you need so , ... or less . .. using visual . ... Yeah , In fact it was a , ... Was the West Coast that nan ... was it the Horizon who said he could .. do the visual with the Twin Cesna ahead , or was it vice versa , one of the two . .. RING Yeah . And at that point I said , .. don't need it now .  ... They got it . ... Somebody in there ? I think Laura went in there , yeah . ... Comm , ... line for you .  have a call on the other line . .. This is Randy . ... Okay . .. Mbye . Another thing I thought was interesting , ... was the , this uh , the emphasis on transportation . Do you remember the automobile ? ... This was the beginning of the uh change . Mhm . None   None uh trains , and uh , ... carriages , automobiles , .. Unhunh . ... and uh , ... Hm . ...   I think Margaret though , Mhm . I- -- ... I don't think we can underestimate her . I mean , I think she's a like a lot of women , .. that I have known . I mean she's in control . ..  there is no doubt . .. I mean , Henry Wilcox may think he's in control , but he isn't , Hm . And there would never be a Jacky Bast . (SNIFF) ... While she ... is ... uh the head of .. of that h- .. household . .. Whereas I thought Missis Wilc- -- the first Missis Wilcox , Ruth , Mhm .  Was so other worldly , and everything else , mhm . She didn't even have a clue , .. as to what was going on . Mhm . ... So I felt that , ... that uh Margaret is , ... is , .. and I thought for this time , she was tremendously , ... uh , ... just in charge . She's very practical . Yeah . Mhm . and she didn't care , .. the- to b- -- to -- she didn't care about emancipation . Mhm . I mean , Mhm . she was . ... Mhm . So she -- when you really are already that way , you don't have to make a big to-do about it . Mhm . Mhm . Mhm . but she also- -- I thought also , in the movie , she had a very strong personality . .. A lot of charia . Mhm .  And very positive . Did you see the movie Diane . Hmm . which is also what you're saying . But , Mhm .  2... but she just radiated something which was 2.. personality . Mhm . ... You know , a funny -- there are two young people that I have talked to about the movie , and I haven't seen it but , one of them , .. uh was my niece , and I said something about Margaret talking about her , feeling that she was the , I think I used the word heroine . ... And she said heroine ? ... And she couldn't see Margaret as a heroine . I think Margaret --  . and then she went on , to explain , she said , maybe she was too strong . ... Uh , we're used to seeing someone as the uh , you know , the protagonist , or the , the woman on the screen , ... as a romantic , as uh all of that , ... And I -- I haven't seen the movie , but that was her feeling about it . Hm . Hunh . Had she read the book also ? You -- No . .. no  , t- -- Just the- None -- No because- --  goes to movies . Okay .  And an- -- be- -- .. Because , the other thing about Margaret that would be uh- a heroine , is that she  marries Henry even though all this has happened . and then she , .. she .. sticks with Henry mhm . even though , all , You know , (COUGH) Mhm , The son ends up killing , (COUGH) You know ,    all this happens , and she sticks it out with Henry .  Yeah . And that , maybe , young people nowadays wouldn't have done .   They wouldn't have thought that heroic . .. They would have thought that , .. marching out and saying I won't stay , you know or , Mhm , I won't marry you or , whatever . MM , I- I wanted to know , excuse me . I wanted to know what ... you thought about , ... why she agreed to marry him ... to begin with . .. Because although I understand .. the reasons that are given in the book , ... I still .. couldn't quite ... decide that , .. that's something she would have decided to do . ... Uh but I n- -- I know what you mean . The only thing I was thinking , maybe she was older ? ... Her chances were , You know , it was .. changing ? Mm , ... And uh , because she was very pleased when he asked her . ... Ha- -- and she admired him , according to the b- -- mm , well I don't think Henry was the horrible person that , but , ... uh , a lot of critics felt ... that he was , ... I think .. maybe .. Forster wanted him to be that way , and I just didn't ... look at it that way , Mhm . when I read about him . But I thought he had a lot of good .. qualities , Did you see some charm there ? ... Mhm . Hm .  ..  Okay . Mhm . Hm . ... This is for the movie . She evidently did . ... Uhuh , Mhm , Well the book she kept saying he was charming , Mhm , Well I read the book too , I mean he -- and I -- he r- -- ... he uh , ... she described him as ... a charming , ... mhm , ... when she was talking about him to somebody , .. Helen or th , in her thoughts or something , Margaret said , ... you know he , ... I mean Mister Wilcox is a charming ... man . ... Hm . Yeah . Hm . Well as long as things are going his way .  I guess I couldn't see any charm . Either place .  and , ... and I -- .. I guess that's what kept kinda s- bringing me up short on ,  ... believing this marriage . ... after all -- or , and the times too , Linda , you know nineteen ten , Mhm , .. there wasn't a .. great deal of opportunity , for a uh -- ... I was gonna say , didn't she think she really had to be married ? ... I don't know ,  but she -- well the- -- I don't know . The thing I didn't understand is , I don't know . why both families were so against Paul and Helen , ...  ... and then the rest of em  -- and yen- -- then Hen- Henry and Margaret got married , and there didn't seem to be any dissension there , Well the her- -- you know ? his kids didn't like that , No , his kids didn't like it , but Henry was against -- but , But the -- well Paul had no future . but the -- Yeah but that was -- Yhe had no money , Paul hadn't made his money . um , or anything , ... and uh , Yeah , I thought it was mainly because of the difference in the families , (COUGH) (COUGH) though , that they , ... perhaps I misunderstood that . LINDA  I don't know . I -- I don't know that either . I I agree more with Linda . that -- that I think it was a situation where Paul  couldn't marry anybody    because he had to go overseas , He didn't have any money , and make his f- -- .. you know , make his way in the world , cause he couldn't support a woman . Mhm . And , .. and maybe , those families see , rather than the Basts , ... who would get married , ... whether they could support somebody or not , .. they strongly felt that you had to have a certain amount of money , or , .. or a certain future in order to -- ... end up -- position . Yeah . Position in order to have a wife . ready to go . Mm .  Did Helen not have enough money to support them I wonder ? (MURMUR_AGREEMENT) .. Why couldn't Helen have just supported them . Well , I think that that was , that wasn't -- they -- ... they wouldn't have allowed that . That's not a -- The Wilcoxes wouldn't have . 2.. That wouldn't have been alright . Look at Missis Wilcox  . according to the Wilcoxes . the- the- the- -- their code of honor . Remember ? the uh -- Yeah . ... strong English honor , that they uh , ... that Charles had to defend ? men would take care of them . .. You know ? Right . ... Except in Out of Africa , when uh Margaret uh , ... when Margaret married uh Mister Wilcox , which is about the same time ,  Mhm , ... Mhm , ... What- -- uh did uh -- it seems to me  in the movie , they were looking at this big house , interior of this big house , did they move to a big house ? ... Where did they live ... I think they lived in the big house , they did live in the big house , they ended up living in Howard's End , for a while , didn't they ? No . Yeahl , at the end . ... They were ... in Howard's End . Who was at Howard's End at the end ? .. I thought it was Helen and the little boy . .. No , .. all of em were at Howard's End . I thought all of em --  -- they all lived in Howard's End , 2.. Henry , Margaret , Buffalo ... Helen , they were all one big happy family  . whole family , Oh my God .  W- .. when uh -- That was kind of unbelievable , wasn't it   .  Tell me another one . and Margaret brought em all together . Well , and when they married , and the other thing -- and when uh .. they married , did uh , .. uh what was his name , the uh .. wimpy little son ? ... Tibby ? the bro- -- Tibby ? did Tibby , .. and the young girl come and live with them ? Tibby . ... I don't know what happened to Tibby . Tibby was -- I don't remember from the book . Well -- Tibby wasn't there . When .. when he- they- -- at the wedding , see , is when Helen , ... uh , ... conceived , and so then , shortly thereafter , she me- went away . She went to like , ... Germany , Germany . or some place like that ? And she stayed in Germany , Okay . Oh . until -- friend of t- -- but that wasn't Margaret's wedding , that was Evie's wedding . ... That was before they got married . Okay . Yeah . 2.. That's right . That was before Margaret even got married , Right . So by the time Margaret gets married ,  ... Maybe they didn't live there the whole time . Helen's pregnant , .. and she's away somewhere . Tibby was gone . because she isn't -- Yeah . ... She's hiding . I see . Essentially . Isn't it 2.. also basically 2.. a woman's -- 2... the women are much more developed characters than the men . (COUGH) (COUGH) .. And the men tend to be , Mhm . not such good people . Yeah . ... I think so . Isn't that interesting , Weak . .. an- -- that he would write that way if he was a homosexual ? ... Except he was raised by his mother None I don't know that everybody agrees with that , and , .. but , .. aunt and so on . ... Yeah , so the- .. the mo- -- pardon ? the mothers have always been uh , ... women .. figures in his life were so strong obviously . ... Mhm . ... .. Bu- .. but .. but the fellow , isn't that what you're saying ? Tibby ? is -- was- isn't that is name ? He- but he was such a wimpy , Mhm . sure physically .. weak , uh person . ... Uh , they all had asthma  . 2 I wouldn't know who- -- they always -- .. Hm . and uh , and Paul wasn't -- even living on the farm None .. they all had uh , Hm . even Charles wasn't . .. .. Diane -- what was it , hay fever , or asthma or something ,  Yes . Diane started to say something about Out of Africa . Yes . Well , .. you're talking about the woman having the money , and why th- m- a man couldn't Mhm . ... Mhm . Marry her . marry the -- Mhm . y- yeah , in .. Out of Africa , I think , is about this same time period . ... Or may- well maybe it's s- second world war . .. But Isak Dinesen , later . the ... heroine of out of Africa is Danish , but she's the one with money , and she ends up -- a -- .. the brother of the person that she's in love with marries her , Yeah , yeah , because he has no money , no family money , but she has money , and she has no way to get a husband , so they agree ... to get married , because he will then .. have access to her money and title , and she'll have a husband . ... So it was done , my point of all that was ,  that it was sometimes done , that a woman of means , married a man of no means , ... as uh , ... an arrangement for what ... ever reason . ...   Yeah I -- and so it .. could have been that this , .. I guess -- that her money could have been the s- source of marriage if they'd wanted it to be . That's to me uh uh , .. kind of a m- -- .. not taken care of , .. very well in the book . .. I I guess I don't ... know why they didn't -- Yeah . why that was such a no no . And I didn't realize Forster grew up with money . That sort of mixed me all up now too , because , Mhm , it sounded to me like he hadn't and , .. Mhm . .. yeah . I have a question about England in nineteen ten , too . ... Which shows that my ... lack of history . Was England the strong world power in nineteen ten ? .. still ? The w- ... empire , English , the sun never sets on the English empire ? Tha- that was where uh , Mhm . a- a- Wilcox made his money . Wasn't it ? In s- -- what was it . Some kind of trade in uh , ... I g- I've forgotten what it was . Hm . ... Uh was it -- he had , I think he had rubber tr- .. plantations . rubber plantations ?  , .. Yeah . Cause I read Passage to India ,  ... a hundred years ago in college , .. and that was all about ... the colony of India . .. Mhm . and .. English colonial things . Mhm . So I thought England was in a .. position of great strength , .. in nineteen ten . .. I think it was . Hm ? I think it probably was .  I think it was .  But it was getting ready to , But the winds of change , 5... move away .  that's right .  were beginning to blow . 7 had begun to blow  .  mhm . Wonder who was the ruler . in nineteen ten . Who was the king or queen ? Mhm . I don't know . Hmm . When -- what was Victoria's reign . .. Well that's what I'm trying to think of . About , .. well close to that , w- -- uh , remember , they uh , Well when did Edward give up , Upstairs Downstairs , I should think it would have been George the Fifth  . The uh , Mhm . mm . Uh , .. Mhm . .. what was it , uh the , ... her son came in ,  in about nineteen ten . Yeah  Victoria's son . ... Was that Edward ? The one that -- ... Yeah . the ward in .. a .. England . The one who was a , .. such a , .. Well he was weak . .. Wasn't he ? Mhm . The one that abdicated ? nan ... No . .. That was later . No . ... That was later . .. Mhm .  ... Well at the beginning of World War ... One , ... in The Guns of August , It was nineteen eighteen . .. They , fourteen .  all of the .. crowned heads , .. was -- .. that was the last time they were all together . So it had already -- was , ... well over the horizon into setting . Mhm . by nineteen fourteen . aOkay . Mhm . So nineteen ten it just -- So in nineteen ten , Mhm . there would definitely have been , Undercurrents . the winds .. of 2.. change .. beginning to -- Mhm . Okay . ... Mhm . But England really didn't start losing her colonies , ... did she , until more like second world war ? ... That's when they div- 2.. divested . Well maybe -- Mhm . Mhm . 3.. was after r- Second World War . Mhm . Okay . Mhm . ... Maybe the power over them was becoming weak ?  -- .. Mhm . .. I -- by this time ? .. wasn't that part of the problem they had ? Cause they were trying to , .. hold the colonies together , and then they also had to deal with the war in Europe ? ... I thought so . I mean wasn't that the problem ? Mhm . That they had to be -- Was that World War Two , or World War One . I don't know . ... I don't know . .. But I think that was part of the problem , because they couldn't be -- More World War Two ,  . Was it Two ? ... Deborah ? I think -- ... Yeah . I think more , .. more was World War Two . Well they were transferring the power in India , weren't they , to be in the thirties . .. Uh , ... more like World War Two . .. Mhm . I mean Neru , when Gandhi -- .. So the thirties and forties maybe . was -- ... Yeah . Mhm . time of Gandhi , and all of that , Mhm . Unhunh . Unhunh . Mhm . ... It was kind of interesting to read these uh , Hm . ... critical .. reviews . I got this out of the book ... review digest . since it was written in nineteen ten . ... Reviews were written in nineteen ten   .   Hm .   Hunh . Here's one -- nan  .. Nineteen ten . nineteen ten . It was published , .. yeah . .. Published in nineteen ten . ... Um , ... Mister Forster , .. this is from the New York Times . in nineteen -- .. February nineteen eleven .   None Mister Forster seems to write conventional comedy . ... for that his sense of character values is entirely adequate    ... while there his blith- blithe manner , and journalistic None wittiness of phrase serves him well . But he invinces neither power nor inclination , to come to grips with any vital human problem .    which totally dis -- disagrees with everything we've been saying this afternoon .  But what a different .. wording of a review ,  too . It's so .. proper , Yes . Mm . Yeah . TRUE . and stilted , Unhunh . and , Yeah . TRUE .  ..  Saturday review said , None whether one likes it or not ,   Howard's End is a real novel .  .. That was in nineteen ten .      and , .. something that , .. nan it was abbreviated capital SPEC .  I don't know .. what it was .  ... But if his defects are exasperating , his qualities are remarkable . .. Vivid characterization , a happy command of dialog , .. and a f- -- .. and a freakish .. humor . ... The clash of modern culture , Hm . .. and modern materiali , has seldom found , a more vivid interpreter . ..    Oh . I've never seen that . Does the library have these magazines on microfilm , Oh my . clear back to nineteen ten ?  Well this is from .. the Book Review Digest . .. So they have all of these little reviews , Ah . Oh I didn't know they had that at- -- on this one page . Uhuh , that they've .. collected , that early . Oh . of --  Oh , My . of his book . I didn't -- haven't seen that .  But Janice . You did an awful lot of research on it . Cause I took that uh -- I mean those reviews ,    Yeah . That was wonderful . Yeah . Yeah . Well I didn't spend too much time putting it together  , But -- Yeah . ((LAUGHTER) None But modern ,  modern culture , and modern .. materiali , ... I mean that's essentially what we're saying . That's what we've been saying . That's right . Culture , Mhm . and materiali . That's right . That's right . So , So they -- That was -- even there they hit it on the head  . uh -- That's right . Mhm . .. The the humor we're having a little trouble with though . That's right . Yeah I , ((LAUGHTER)  the humor . .. well ,  although , it was ,  ... There were- -- there were times when it w- -- .. it was under- underlying humor , a little bit , Mhm . You know , English humor . the- -- The like -- like the t- -- .. in the movie at least , that , .. when the Basts come to the , to the wedding reception , and , .. and , Oh yes . Jacky , sits down there and starts shoveling in the food , and drinking the drinks , and it's really  -- It's funny until then they have the confrontation with Henry . Right . And then it isn't funny anymore . Right . Mm . But it is kind of humorous . Well I -- (%) I was gonna tell you of the one oth- -- the other , uh young person , that I talked to about the book , was a former student , who is now a psychiatrist , who lives in California . .. We were talking about the book , or about the movie . .. He hadn't read the book . He said , it was a good movie , but not a great movie . ... And he said it was without passion . ... Oh my . Hm . Hm . So , Now , 2 Oh , good heavens 22 . what do you make of that . I don't know w- --  M . I think that's typical of English movies .  He definitely wouldn't like 5.. Michael  . Well , That's -- Uh uh yeah .  I I really do . I thought , .. uhuh . I thought , and I think I said , well , maybe it was because it was English . They are -- Unhunh . it's all kind of uh -- I don't know how you can say it's without passion .  I didn't think so either , I mean , But I didn't argue . Well the passion of Leonard Bast , and and Helen , and then the passion of Charles , and the confrontation with Leonard -- Mhm . No but that's tragedy . .. That's not necessarily passion . the- -- Well what uh -- NO but it was  --  what are we talking about passion . Well I think it -- Let's define passion . Well  I think how we define it .  passion means to  Yeah . Passion , Mhm . I think probably he meant , well , trong feeling . Yeah . Not sex . Yeah . Mhm . but more strong feeling . Mhm . Look at Margaret's uh , Well certainly there wasn't passion between ... Henry .. and .. Margaret . ... Yeah there was . No . Oh yes there was ? No . but strong feelings . but -- Strong -- Well , Strong feeling , strong feeling , I mean it isn't -- but not passionate . I don't think there's strong feelings in this book that much . nly for Howard's End . ... Ruth had -- % Ruth had strong feelings for Howard's End , and it didn't do her one bit of good , .. because it- -- her .. bequest was ignored , and the rest of the people are just kind of .. floating along . .. Oh no no no no no . ..  See , I don't get that . Helen has tremendous passion about her beliefs . .. Margaret's speech to Henry , Well about her beliefs , but they don't make one bit of difference , .. in the whole world . Margaret's speech to Henry ,  ... is one of the most passionate things I have ever read . Well I found that part  . I thought , She mowed him down , didn't she .  I thought it was beautiful , Mhm . and later it says , she thought back over that , and she wouldn't have changed a word of it .  absolutely , oh I think there was a lot of feeling , .. a lot of feeling . ... Was this novel popular when it was published ? ... Uh , according to the professor ,    that it is a classic of change . ... It is w- uh one of the uh , classic novels , that has to do with change . But did the people like it . ... Tradition and change . When they read it . Back then . I would imagine that he was popular with  , Well is it being revived now ? I think he was popular . Or , seems to be . well , in the introduction it said , I don't know . that in the forties , They are doing that with so many of those now . when they w- -- you had uh , Fitz- uh gerald , and uh , .. Hemingway , and other well-known writers , .. uh , Hemingway and Faulkner , and , and yet this guy was still up there in the forties . .. And this book was written in nineteen ten . I didn't care for it . .. I -- well you know what turned me off ? The .. the hi- the big description about the dumb old umbrella . .. ((LAUGHTER) and did the umbrella have uh , a ooth end on it , did it have a knobby end , ((LAUGHTER) and I thought , .. for crying out , why am I sitting wasting my time reading about umbrela hands .    and then Helen says , and , 24.. and the description of the music , None oh , we gr- -- we steal umbrellas all the time None . and    We steal em all the time .  That was part of the humor . There's got to be something better to read .  Hunh .  Now that was supposed to be part of the --  I did -- I did not enjoy -- None Was that supposed to be humor ? ... I- I- -- That's English humor  . Did you enjoy it ? Somewhat . Mhm .  Or at least 6.. Helen and Margaret's humor . I did not enjoy reading the book .  6.. above average . That was their humor . Mhm . .. I just couldn't  .  But I enjoyed 8.. the movie . 8.. Couldn't quite get into it .  .. Yeah . I think that helped me appreciate the book . Well Evelyn helped me .. stay with the book . .. Because she said it was written in a different time , .. and of course it's British , ... and so , .. because I was having trouble getting started . I .. got hung up ,  and it doesn't make any difference , but , .. when you were reading the review , you talked about the affair between Helen and Paul , .. did I get the right names , .. And I thought , .. all that happened was , was a kiss . He --  He kissed her , and , and they had -- I thought so too . I thought so too . And they had this , .. and they had this understanding of the souls , Oh , yes . that they were in love . Yeah . I think that's TRUE . 6 And --  and I'm thinking , what is the big deal about this . This aunt is coming down here ,  Everybody's getting in an uproar ,  because somebody thought they liked somebody . I -- .. you know , I got lost in that , and , I talked to Evelyn , and she said now y- just stay with it , it's written in a different time , and I thought okay , a different time , yes , maybe that is important ,  2 You know   ,  Come on . Well Lori ,  did you see the movie , So , .. No , I'm going to rent it . .. After I leave here today  . See I think -- I think it's better to see the movie first ,  I am too Lori ,  and then read the book . I think it'll help . .. I think it -- I think , Well , and it's getting a little f -- M . It's a good way to do it . 2.. you know , I'm getting more into the characters .  Well , Mhm . One time in this group ,   .. and I think it was , .. I don't remember if it was Evelyn .. or .. Deborah . .. But it was probably  -- it was one of those people who are so knowledgeable ,  it wasn't , was --   Oh . certainly wasn't any of us . Might have been Nora Come on . Tell me about it . ((LAUGHTER) He -- He talked , nan They talked about what makes a classic .   .. Oh . And they had several criteria , Oh . and I've forgotten some of them ,  Oh . but the ones I can think of , is that it has to be able to be read .. on many levels . .. Yeah . And I think that this is one of those books , This one does . that you can read , as just a story about these people who are wanting to- to live at this Howard's End , or you can read it .. as the clash between the intellectual , and the practical , or between .. England .. and Germany . .. Which is really what they're getting down to was the basis of thata , Mhm . Mhm . That was something . Mhm . It can be read at any time , .. it can ap- .. NAME? to England in nineteen ten , ... or it can apply to America in nineteen ninetythree , with how far are we going to go with entitlements , ..  how much are we going to take from the uh , .. so called really wealthy , who's the only people that's going to be touched by this budget , ((LAUGHTER) Yeah , how nice  . And .. all of these things , and give to these poor . You forg- --  5 I mean even the 5 -- You forgot the corporate income tax which is going up and up and up and up and up , and if somebody says entitlements one more time I'm gonna scream . Okay , I won't say that . Why are these entitlements . I won't say that . Why are you entitled to this . The corporate income tax is going to be raised 5.. one .. percent .  a None And so therefore the g- big corporations in the US are backing this budget change in Washington . ...  Well , at any rate , .. I think there's --  That is as --   as typical today , I mean as topical today as it was then . And then it has to deal , .. with the big questions . ... Uh the- -- .. of moral values , .. and of w- ... how you ... uh perceive the world , Mhm . and all of this with it . And I -- there were some others . And I can't even remember what they all were . .. But I -- I know , but it was Evelyn who did it , and we ought to make her get her notes out again . Because sh- -- Yes .  If you can find this . She probably remembers . ((LAUGHTER) Uh Evelyn , I don't remember . will you do that again some  None Oh ,  I will remember . I just I just can't remember what it was . But I thought there were five , and I've only come up with four   . (SNIFF) Hm . I thought she had five . 8.. Oh , I only heard three . .. What was the --  let's -- The -- ... Well the eternal truths , ... at any time , ... on any level , Oh eternal truths . .. Yeah . I missed the eternal truth .  At any time , on any level , and by any age . ... Mhm . Uh , well you didn't mention one thing , I thought it was very interesting , and I thought you all w- i- who are married , would have picked up on it , the relation between a man and a woman . I thought there was one phrase in there , the crystal -- ... what was it . The crystal uh ... shield . that comes down , after , a couple is married . ... Oh , And I have realized that ,  . so many times with friends , Hm . with whom I was very very intimate . You know . And yet , .. when they are married , .. Hm . there is a conjugal nan ... Mhm . nan oneness , ... that is uh , ... something that I was never able to penetrate . Stoods . Mhm . Mhm . Mhm . Hm . And I thought that was an interesting phrase . Mhm .  I also thought it was very interesting , her relation , with her husband . ... Mhm .  Why she married him , I don't know , but ,  .. she was able to see the good in any . ... As well as the bad , Mhm .   Hm . and to live with it . And continue to , Yeah . sort of , ... push at the bad , None You know , um , and try to improve him .  She kept see- -- Mhm . Maybe it's because she did it with open eyes . .. Mhm yeah . None In the movie , ... you see her , ... looking out her window , ... across the street , into the Wilsons' apartment . ... And they seem to be a happy , very happy congenial family . ... They seem to have a lot of interaction going on in that family . Mhm . I don't know , It's -- maybe there was something , That's TRUE . by the fact that she , she saw , uh , ... a happy family , they talked and communicated , and laughed , and , ... had a good association with each other . ... As she peeked out her window , ... looking at this uh family . That's a good point . Well , and I think , Yeah . But -- I think so . Ruth -- ... Miss- -- .. the first Missis Wilcox .. thought highly of her husband . ... and Margaret thought highly of her . Mhm . And do you remember when she was going to .. go down to Howard's End with her ? Mhm . ... And all of a sudden he appeared . He came back , Mhm . and Missis Wilcox said , .. well I'm so glad to see you , and she walked away with her husband . Hm . Mhm . Well I think Janice is right . .. That he was charming , and I'm forget -- I think we forget , .. that we all have that innate need ... to have a partner . ... I mean , Well , .. and , and a provider . Too . Yeah . You know , Mhm . Yeah . he took care of everything . I mean , 4.. we all -- we all envy that oneness . Mhm . ... Mhm . Mhm . Mhm . .. And when you don't have it , you really envy it . Mhm . Mhm . .. So , ... I mean , that's a r- a strong drawing point . .. We look over a lot of things , .. I mean none of us would be married if we were married .. perfect partners . Mhm .   definite . Mhm .  Yeah . Yeah . r if they were looking for perfect nan Hm . nan ... in us . Mhm . Mhm . ..

(SNIFF) None That she could see .. the ... human qualities , Yeah . ... Maybe that's one thing about the book , uh what .. what Evelyn -- what uh Lois said , (SNIFF) was that , .. you know , ... it translates to everybody . Nobody's husband is perfect . Mhm . Mhm . y- n- or no -- and nobody is perfect .  Or no person . 5 Mhm . Mhm . Mhm 6 . No person is perfect . 7     And therefore , Mhm .

Hearts . It's the card game . Oh yeah ? ... Put it up there . ... Wanna play hearts ? Let's check that one out . ... yneat -- ... wait , .. play novice . I've never played hearts before ,  You've never played Hearts ? in my life . .. No , I don't know how to play it . .. Oh . ... Okay . I'll teach you . .. Passing disabled . That's you . Queen of sp- -- ... ... irst lead rotates .  First , yeah . .. .. Always pass left . ... ... Alright . ... So this is us . Groucho , Harpo  , .. (%) The object , okay , every heart , ... okay , every heart is one point , Is tr- -- the q- queen of spades is thirteen points , the object is not to have any points . .. And , you play following suit , ... and , ... you can take , if you take tricks , th- the highest card of the suit , takes the trick . If you don't have the card of the suit , you throw whatever you want .  Okay . So h- hearts , .. and the queen of spades , Are bad . are the only thing . That are -- That -- that have points . That are points . Right .  So if you- -- .. So , if you throw -- nan Look okay . y- -- so we got like three points , right here . ... Right . we have three points in our hand , exactly . And we w- wanna try to get rid of that .  NRight , but we're passing . Now the first thing you do is you pass three cards to your left . Now these are low hearts . So I can -- .. I'm not gonna pass those . I'm gonna pass , ... the f- .. four of clubs , All the -- y- right- -- ... Why is that . ... And these are two high -- why -- just because . And -- cause you should always pass a club , .. so that the person -- .. so that the first hand , y- .. everyone has a club , so that they can't .. discard a heart . Cause you always assume that everyone's t- -- no one is void , of a suit . The first time around , so you don't have to worry about throwing a high card . Yeah . .. Yeah .  And then I'm gonna throw two high cards , so I don't take those tricks . Because  nan  But what difference does it make if you take a trick .  Well because None -- They're not worth anything .  Cause if I t- -- If I take a tr- -- the k- diamond trick , and somebody didn't have diamonds , and they threw a heart into that pile , I was gonna take that , with that ace . ... So if I throw an ace of diamonds , and somebody doesn't have any diamonds , they're gonna throw a heart on me , and I'm gonna have to take that trick .   Okay , but , but if they play hearts , that doesn't -- 2.. that doesn't win anything . 2... I- -- If they play h- -- nokay . Just go ahead and play . Okay . Alright ? So I'm passing three sthree cards . And I got ,  the seven of hearts , three of hearts , and the king of f- spades . Begin play . The two of clubs always leads , .. I'm gonna throw the ace of clubs , assuming I'm gonna take this trick , Okay- -- .. Okay .  no one have to -- and then- -- and everybody -- Right . So it's kinda risky playing the king , since , But I'm gonna assume everyone has clubs still . Okay . Alright .  Okay , cause there are thirteen cards , I'm assuming it's an equal deal . Now there are eight clubs out , that means there are only four more left . So you don't -- y- -- .. so you wanna play , .. So I'm gonna- -- A high d- -- high diamond . ... Yeah , exactly . Like a high diamond . So jack of diamonds . .. Okay , taken with None None Okay , so he took that . Okay .  Now the spade , so now -- Now this is a tricky one , now , If I have a high spade now , I'd throw it , because I could take this trick , and the h- my highest spade would be out . Now I don't ever wanna take the queen of spades , high spades are dangerous because you might -- queen of spades is a hard cr- card to get rid of .  So if , .. yeah okay , I see . Now I don't have- -- oh I do have a spade . Well you're in a good position now , because you've seen what everybody else has played . ... Right . That's why . Diamond , So you have to play a diamond .  Now h- -- Right ? Right , and there have been no diamond- -- Has there been a diamond trick ? There's been one diamond trick . uh , y- -- .. yeah . w- only one though . Yeah . Right ? Yeah . .. Okay . ... Yeah , you played your ace . Okay now it was led , .. the spade was led , ... but there's a heart in this trick . So I wanna get under the seven . ... Because I don't wanna take this trick . Because there's a heart . Okay .  But that's easy , cause I only have two spades ,  and they're both under seven . .. so you would have taken that , If I had a eight .  So now , you can still get under that ,  I could still get under so  , Alright  . too . 3.. He's got an eight . So you- --  Now listen , ... Okay now , b- two different people took .. hearts . Now , if you t- have all -- if you take all the points , ... if you take all the points . All thirteen hearts , and the queen of diamonds , So that's twenty-six points .  it's called , right . It's called shooting the moon , and you get -- ... you give everyone else .. twenty-six points , ... or else you're minus twenty-six points . ... And that's good . ... Shooting the moon is really hard to do . Now look it , I don't have a club , ... So you can throw a heart . there you go . A high heart . Okay . ... I don't have a club . ... Now , .. somebody else did take hearts . Right ? ... Or did he -- ... or am I mistaken . .. I thought ev- someone else did take hearts , I think somebody else did take hearts . Queen of spades gonna have to come up m- -- n , There . there it is . He led , .. id he just shoot the moon ? ... I thought someone else took -- ... No . Ch- -- Yeah . So he got -- Groucho got one heart , One , and Chico got twentyfive . So he's b- kinda bumming right now . So he sucks . right . .. Okay . So pass three cards . So we wanna ... pass , None .. Alright . Pass , so we're gonna pass , the king of .. spades . King of ... puppy-dogs feet . ...  ... How come you don't pass the king of .. clubs . .. I might . ... I don't have any aces here . .. I'm gonna pass a low heart . ... Just so they can't shoot the moon . I got the ace of hearts , ... Okay . ... Two of clubs . King of clubs . Ace is out . So my queen is the highest there . ... Alright , my jack is the highest there . ... So you wanna play that now . .. Oh , .. Well I'll do it . ... So you took that one . Yeah . .. But that doesn't make any difference None . Right . ... Now the two -- ... See , .. alright . .. Now . Diamonds are a- wasted . ... Alright . ... Did you just take that ? .. No . That heart ? No ? No . Groucho has the uh , .. Spades were led . The f -- So you play , Spade was led , The ace .  Take- -- Can you play a club , ... if spades were led , and you didn't have , I can -- ... Yeah , I can -- But , but if you had hearts ? Yeah .  So you can play anything then . I can lead -- I can pl- -- th- I can play anything . So why don't you just get rid of high clubs . .. Right . I'm thinking I'm gonna know -- who's -- G- Harpo's gonna take this , so the ... points are split now . ... So I don't have to worry . .. Now the queen is the highest , so , ... Two l- -- the two of hearts is a great lead . You can't lead hearts , unless hearts have already been dropped , also . Yeah . ... .. Oh shit . ... Oh fuck . I took a point there . .. I'm gonna take all the rest , I think . .. Um , ... How can you . Maybe not . ... Oh man . ... I knew it . I'm gonna take all the rest . ... Fuck . ... I just got like seven points . shit . ... Eight . ...    ... Alright , I have no spades . This is a really good hand . ... I have no spades whatsoever . ... It's really good . ... Play hearts .  I'm gonna try to shoot the moon . So Eraus laid the the- -- laid the egg , which Luther hatched . ... And um , .. when you come then , .. to , uh , however this debate . .. This freedom of the will . Um , ... I think uh , let me read you a .. page from Brendler . .. Because it sets the sa- stage very nicely . This is in the Luther book some of you are reading , and um , ... if you , this evening when you go home , if you wanna meditate it on more , on- on it more , it's on page three eleven . ... It's on page three eleven . .. But , let me just read you the , cause this gives us the setting very nicely , and then .. we can .. uh , .. Eraus entitled his anti-Luther pamphlet , ... diatribe .. concerning free will . ... Once again , ... the first .. and fundamental questions , disputed in fifteen sixteen , and fifteen seventeen , and again in Heidelberg , .. in April of fifteen eighteen , None with which Luther had opened the assault on scholastic theology , were debated . ... Luther was glad to take up the theme of this debate . ... And this is what Luther writes to Eraus . ... You alone . ... Among all the others , have recognized the key question . And you do not bore me . With the Papacy , .. purgatory , .. indulgences , .. and similar nonsense . You , and you alone , have identified that on which all else hinges . And you have put the razor to the throat . And for that .. I thank you heartily . ... Um , .. thus Luther evalu- uh evaluated the subject . And Eraus commented on the significance of their engagement , .. in battle , .. in his own style . .. And he wrote to Luther . .. Perhaps an Eraus ... who writes ... against you , will do more for the Gospel , than certain dunderheads ... who support you . ... And then , .. humanistic thinking , will never consent , .. this is Brendler now , obs- -- uh on this uh , but this sets the stage for what we're gonna .. talk about , humanistic thinking will never consent , to the doctrine of original sin . ... Pico de la Mirandela would not have consented to the doctrine of original sin . .. The author of uh , .. what is it , Houseman I think , of Invictus . .. I am the master of my fate , I am the captain of my soul . I don't think that he would .. acknowledge original sin . Is based uh , alright , what is it , it's based , as it is , on the concept , that human nature is totally depraved , and of itself not capable of any good will . And that apart from grace alone , free will is nothing , .. can do nothing , .. does nothing , except depraved deeds . Even though these pronouncements are Biblically based , .. and may be acceptable within an exclusively theological system , they do not appear ... reconcilable with the dignity of man- -- dignity of man . Catholic , ... and semipelagiani , ... with all of it's emphasis on on the role of prevenient grace , finally views , .. free will , .. as the decisive factor in attaining salvation . Thereby conceptualizing free will , as similar to a healthy .. man- -- healthy human understanding , for how can a person , be responsible for his deeds , .. if he possesses no free will . ... This is what Eraus asked . ... How can he decide between good and evil . ... So reasoned Eraus . Such arguments , ... long known to Luther , ... and many times .. presented to him , .. impressed him not in the least . ... God alone is salvation . God alone measures guilt . He alone condemns . He alone grants grace . Justifies and saves . .. When he will , .. and whom he will . Man can do nothing against the divine prerogative . Man can only accept the divine judgment . ... This is in fact best . And if by -- And -- .. and it is by the divine prerogative , .. that man .. will -- uh , that man is well provided for . .. For God alone is infallible , .. and his being is grace and mercy . ... This concept , ... that man is divinely elected to salvation , or to damnation , is the center of the predestination dogma . .. That later , .. the Geneva reformer Calvin , made the center of his teaching . And that subsequently , under other historical preconditions and circumstances , could be linked closely with a prosperous middle class , in the Netherlands , and in England . ... Um , ... uh , skip this paragraph , this is the paragraph though . Right here . The next one . .. P- on page three twelve . When you , .. when you read- -- if you wanna read it later . Therefore , .. Luther did not accept rational arguments against predestination doctrine . Such arguments , on the contrary , necessarily appeared to Luther , given his theological orientation , as suspicious . .. From the very start . Because they originated from human nature . Which exalted itself against God . .. The whore .. reason . Prefers to submit to the Devil . Adjusts to all situations . And proves .. everything , that is demanded of her . ... Human nature , .. does not .. possess .. free will . It is like a horse . Ridden by God or the Devil . ... The rider possesses the will . ... The horse .. obeys . ... Well that's as clear as you can get it . ... Human nature is like a horse . ... Ridden by God or the Devil . ... The rider possesses free will . ... The horse obeys . ... Alright that , thnow the debate is joined you see . And as you come -- as Eraus comes to this , he's going to say , well let's look at the Scriptures . ... Now , .. number one , we have to admit first- -- .. v- first off , that there seem to be passages , there are passages in the Scriptures , .. are there not ? Many . .. Which seem to teach , that man is responsible for his deeds , and that he may act , and has a free will to respond to the invitation of God . Isn't that clear in the Scriptures ? Whosoever will may come . ... Um , .. Jesus turned to his disciples , you remember , when some deserted him , and .. seemed , because they were disappointed in .. some of his sayings , and they were offended by some of the things he said , ... and they walked no longer with him it said . ... And then he turned to those who remained , and he said , Will ye also go away ? ... They had a choice . Didn't they ? ... Will you go away . .. What do you will . .. And the will , .. apparently was , re- resided in .. in these disciples . And so Eraus is going to say , so obviously , in Scripture we have .. paradox . ... We have clear passages of Scripture , which seem to indicate that man .. POUND has a free will , .. and that he can exercise POUND that will , .. to follow , or not to follow . To respond or not to respond . On the other hand , we have passages of Scripture , which .. seem to indicate , ... that the will is not free , ... and that the , and that man i- th- is- -- man is predestined .. by a .. an omnipotent sovereign will of God . ... We have to take both these pass- -- So it's not a question of the Scriptural authority . .. We both accept the scriptural authority . And Eraus in his writings , and in his pamphlet the Liber Arbetrio , in his pamphlet the Liber Arbetrio , says to Luther , qu- because it is addressed to Luther you see , he says to Luther , uh , I will not church -- .. I will not .. question , or I not -- I will not quote . I will not quote the Church Fathers to you , because I understand you accept no Church Father authority , if it is in disagreement with your opinion  So I will quote the only authority that you recognize , .. The Holy Scriptures . ... And so , .. uh , exclusively Eraus will appeal to the Scriptures , as his basis . When God created Adam and Eve in the garden , he placed them in the garden , and he said you have a choice .  Uh , you have a choice . Do not eat of the fruit of the knowledge of the good- -- of the tree of good and evil , for on the day ye eat thereof , ye shall surely die . .. Now , do not do that , .. and obviously God must have given , the first created pair , a choice . Because the whole system .. of reward or punishment , .. is based upon the decision which is .. these individuals made . Or , when Cain slew Abel .  Um , .. if you do well ? .. Shall you not be s- sustained ? But if you do evil ? Sin .. crouches at the door . ... If you do well . ... Apparently , from this , ... Cain .. had the ability , .. even after the mur- -- even after the murder of Abel , he had the ability , to make a positive choice . .. According to Eraus . That's going to be his position . Well Luther , .. um , .. I'll g- I'll I'll tell- say some of the things that he he picked first , Eraus picked first , and um , .. he's gonna go all through the Scriptures , and he's gonna take passages like this , um , ... return return the prophets said , did they not to ancient Israel . Return to the God of the covenant , return Hosea pleads with Gomer , .. please come back .. tyou see . And uh , this is the symbol of Israel , come back to the Lord , come back to the the husband of the covenant , come back to the one who called you and summoned you , it's the- -- Eraus says the whole premise is , that you have a- an ability , to return . That you can make up your mind , to change the course that you're now taking . And that you can .. go this way , .. or you can go that way . And uh , .. then there are other arguments which are , uh , .. here's uh , here's one on um , I'll read an excerpt , ... in this uh , in this little book , this is the um , .. the actual uh , ... wr- writings of the s- f- .. freedom of the will , .. here's he .. he uses Ecclesiastes . ... God , and this is a quote , from the b- -- .. from the book . God made man from the beginning , .. and left him in the hand of his own counsel . ... He added his commandments , ... and .. precepts . ... If thou would keep the commandments , .. and perform acceptable .. fidelity forever , .. they shall .. preserve thee . ... He hath set w- -- he hath set water and fire before thee . ... Stretch forth thy hand , to which thou wilt . ... Before man is life and death . ... Good and evil . ... That which he shall choose , shall be given him . ... Choose . ... So Eraus's argument is , .. you have a right to choose . You can choose . And therefore if you can choose , this presupposes ... that you have a free will . In any rate , ... if .. man is , ... uh , if there is a necessity in man's action . If he is predetermined to sin . .. If .. if God has already determined , that this person .. commits these acts . Then .. there can be no responsibility on the part of the actor . On the part of the perpetrator . Because how can a person be held responsible for deeds , which he does , .. if he mself did not will those , the- f- -- if , in other words , he may will those deeds , but those -- th- those deeds were imposed upon his will by a transcendent force .  If that is the case , then there is really no freedom of the will . And if uh , in that case , therefore , a person cannot be responsible for his deeds , if the deeds which he commits , have already been eternally foreordained . .. This is uh , this is going to be then Eraus's argument , ag- on this qu- on this question of the freedom of the will . But uh , .. uh , .. we'll .. look at another couple p- uh of his passages . If , .. here it is . If the will .. were not free , ... sin could not be attributed to man . ... It ceases to be sin . ... If it is not voluntary . .. Free will is not extinct . ... Though it has contracted a paralysis . ... ... How is it paralyzed . Well it's paralyzed by the fall . ... See we all .. participate in the Adamic nature . ... And this Adamic nature , .. uh , when Adam , .. in Adam , remember the New Eng- .. New England primer , in Adam's fall , we sinned all . (SNIFF) So , this Adamic nature has been , .. has been passed on to all generations of humans . And so therefore while we -- we have a free will , it is -- it is paralyzed . .. It's not the will .. that was there . .. It's not the will , ... that uh , ... that Adam had . ... Because .. it no longer .. has the freedom .. that Adam had . It is cursed by sin . It is under the curse of sin . So the human will , somehow , is paralyzed . ... Uh Eraus admits that . And then , Eraus will say , that um , ... God then enables . What God does , and this will be the C- really the modern Catholic view . That God will provide a prevenient grace . ... A prevenient grace . That is in other words , even though I am unwilling to accept the gift of salvation , you see , that um , ... that God will give me a prevenient grace , which will .. enable me , .. to move toward .. this salvation . ... And if I then respond . .. positively . .. To the gift of God , then .. God will extend .. the exemplary grace to me , .. which enables me ... to acquire salvation . So prevenient grace , will put you on the path . ... If you respond on the path , then God extends the exemplary grace , which will lead you home . He uses a little story . ... A little .. uh .. uh .. allegory . .. Or figure I guess . ... Uh there uh there's a n- -- ... there's a tot , .. a toddler . ... .. Uh , ... but he's got to be nan .. big enough to appreciate apples . .. Okay ?  Because ,  his , alright ,  because that's the , that's part of the story  . There a .. nice .. shiny .. apple . .. Over here . ... .. Over here , you see . ... And this .. little .. tot , ... he sees the apple . ... And he uh , .. he needs , .. he wants to get to this apple . ... Um , ... so he starts ... in the direction of the apple . But he's very unsteady . He wavers . You see , and he's not , so , what .. is the prevenient grace . The prevenient grace is the adult , which .. doesn't .. take him .. to the apple , .. doesn't lift him up and put him next to the apple , b- but ...% ... goes along with him , just guiding him , making sure that he .. he doesn't fall , he just , .. he lets him get there .. But .. he just .. more or less , supports or sustains the little tot , in his motion .. toward the apple . So the little tot you see , ... Has decided he wants the apple . Once he sees it , .. uh , then he , he moves toward it . Prevenient grace assists him .. toward that apple . It doesn't , .. as I said , it doesn't carry him there , it doesn't .. go get the apple and bring it to him , he must go to the apple . But he goes sustained by this prevenient grace . And then , if he , .. if he half way to the apple , if he decides he doesn't want it , ... if he .. if he sees something he th- considers more attractive , .. and he goes off on a tangent , or goes off in a different direction , then you see , .. then his will has decided that he does not want to cooperate . ... With prevenient grace .  Luther hated that word cooperation . W- particularly in connection with grace . .. Now Luther's position is , .. we are dead ... in trespasses and sin . You see . .. There is nothing that can .. come to us , you see now Luther came to his reformation remember , with this fear of the righteousness of God .  The righteousness of God . And Luther all through his monastic life , up until around fifteen fifteen , is probably when he made that tower discovery . .. That so-called Turmerlebnis . The tower experience . ... Where reading in Romans one seventeen , ... he read , you know , ... ... the j- the just .. shall live by faith , well , .. you have to take rea- really read Romans one sixteen first . ... Um , .. I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ . .. .. For it is the power of God onto salvation . ... To everyone that believeth , .. to the Jew first , ... and also to the Greek . None For therein , ... therein , it can only refer grammatically to Gospel , you see . I am not ashamed of the Gospel . For therein . Is the righteousness of God revealed . ... As it is written . ... The just .. shall live .. by faith . ... And , when he discovered this , he had read this a hundred times . .. But this one time when he read it , he said , ... suddenly it dawned on him . ... What this meant . ... And this place in Paul , Luther said , Became for me , the gate of paradise . ... Es ging mir ein Licht auf . ... The light broke in on me . ... And what was this light . ... That the righteousness of God , ... is passive righteousness . .. It's not the righteousness , you see , Luther said , I hated that .. that phrase righteousness of God . What does righteousness of God mean . Righteousness of God means , God is holy . And I'm a sinner . ... And I can never stand in his presence . And the gulf between us can never be bridged , .. and he's gonna cast me into Hell , because of my sin . What shall I do to earn the righteousness of God . So you see he was constantly preoccupied with this thought , of somehow , satisfying the righteousness of God . Through some work . .. Through some indulgence . Through some prayer . S through- through- renunciation . Through fasting . Through vigils . You know , he says , if a monk , if a m- m- -- if ever a monk could've gained heaven through his monkery , it would have been I .  None  None You see ? ((LAUGHTER) I mean , I mean  , None if ever a monk , could've gained heaven through his monkery , it would've been I .  Because he d- he did everything , .. that he thought would , .. would make God respond .. sympathetically to him . And and pacify this righteousness . And he was always miserable . ... And then he discovered , it's nothing that I do . ... It's what I accept in faith . .. Namely , ... the sacrifice of Christ , the vicarious sacrifice of Christ , for my sin on the cross , I reach out , .. I accept that , ... as my -- .. and .. and then the righteousness of God , is .. imputed to me . ... It's given to me . ... The .. the just shall live .. by faith . ... And so , this life .. in God comes to you not , .. not , it's not God None , th- this deus absconditus , this concealed God , this angry God , this God who's waiting to throw you into Hell at any minute , None that .. that was the image that Luther had . And now you see , and and and works were associated with this . His works . What do I have to do , what do I have to do to placate him . What do I have to do to please him . And now you see the breakthrough comes . So , Luther , from his point of view , you see , he's coming at it from an angle of a .. of an Augustinian monk . He's coming at it from that . With this travail of soul . This agony and anguish of looking for this God . So , he is , .. after this discovery , he is going to .. detest anything .. in theology , which acks of human effort , ... or human work , ... sufficient ... to please God , .. or to placate God . No . ... There is nothing you can do to please God . .. God .. loves you , .. he gives you his grace , totally out of his grace , .. and nothing from your merit . ... So the human will cannot , .. you cannot decide to accept God , and his grace . ... Even the gift of faith . It's interesting in um , .. in Bonifas , in his book uh , now he's a French Huguenot . So you would expect it . But it's still , it comes in an interesting scene . .. Where he's in one of the camps . It's in the second world war , he's in the concentration camp in Germany , ... and it's very , b- it's a beautifully written book . And and he , uh , he's in this scene , in this camp , .. and , ... you know , .. you just wanna give up , aI mean , every day is , you're hanging onto life ... by your .. fingernails . And um , .. he said , ... every day , we just lived for one day . We lived one day at a time . And then he said it dawned on me , that um , .. I I prayed , I lifted up my voice to the Lord , we prayed together , and I prayed , and , and he said then it came to me . .. That .. what sustains me in this situation , in this concentration camp , .. what sustains me , .. is my , ... my deep faith .. in God . ... And then he said , ... and then it dawned on me , ... that this deep faith , which I have in God , ... is not ... my creation . ... Well that's interesting , isn't it . ... This faith ... was given me . ... I did not create it , ... I did not conjure it up , ... it came to me . ... It was given to me . ... That's the testimony of a Huguenot . .. Inmate .. in a concentration camp . .. Well let's take a break . . ... I Just wanted to go over the changes in the schedule ? ... Um originally , .. we were going to require the um , ... request for statement of interest and qualifications to come .. back to , ... uh , ... twenty North Clark Street , on April seventh . ... Um , .. but the , ... um , ... coordinating council felt that it was wise to give the community , ... more time , ... a weekend , .. two days , ... to uh ... augment .. whatever application people were gonna submit ,  so the due date is changed from .. April .. seventh , .. to April eleventh , at noon . ... And you can drop off those proposals at twenty North Clark Street . ... Um , the same .. process ... will continue , .. but for the changes in the time , at the time that you .. drop off your proposal , .. you will be scheduled for a uh .. public .. meeting , ... where you will be given a chance and an opportunity to present your uh proposal . .. Um right now we're looking at April fifteenth , which is a Friday , and s- -- .. and April sixteenth , .. as the uh date for that public presentation , .. and we don't know , .. where that will be held , or what time that will be held , but we'll make sure that everyone gets noticed about that . ... During April seventeen to the twentythird , the coordinating council will identify the empowerments on location , and uh , .. during the week of uh April twentyfifth , (COUGH) there will be a city-wide meeting to present the selected empowerment zone , uh to go over how that zone was selected , ... and uh , ... the place date and time for that meeting .. will also be announced . .. .. Um , .. from May second to June third , the strategic plan , .. for the empowerment zone , (COUGH) ... will be developed , .. with the community , ... and during the week of June sixth , um , a public presentation of , .. on the uh empowerment zone application , and the strategic plan will presented- be presented again , the place date and time .. will be announced . um , ... and on June thirtieth , that's the drop dead date , .. um , when we will send the application , .. for selection by HUD as an empowerment zone for Chicago . ... Um , ... is- if there are no other questions , um , we can , ... yes sir . ... I have a question . Yeah . .. Worst case scenario . ... After we submit em , ... the- uh the proposal application , ... uh , human beings being what they are , .. organizations being what they are . ... what .. will the coordinating council , what does the city propose to do , ... when there's a hue and cry . ... from those who attempting ... to empower themselves , ... and combined with coupled with those who are seeking more power . ... Who say unfair , ... this ... wasn't done right , ... according to ... our perspective , ... or this that and the other . ... that would be the worst case scenario ,  -- worst case scenario . What can .. the city , what -- ... what can the coordinating council , ... or what's gonna be p- -- .. be in place , ... to ... listen to all the criticis , .. all of the ... disappointments at , .. not being selected , ... so that , ... let's say optimistically , .. there are some good ideas . ... some oversight , or something that can be corrected , ... hopefully that's ... of minor proportion . ... So that , ... we can still keep the city , ... running oothly , ... and becoming more and more beautiful . ... I don't know if that issue has been discussed by the um coordinating council ? I think it's a legitimate issue , ... um , ... I w- y- would be willing to take that back , to have them discuss that , but , .. I mean the worst thing would be for , .. HUD not to recognize that this is a c- collaborative effort , a partnership , between the community , the city , the business community and the neighborhoods , and , .. I mean it wouldn't bode well , ... for Chicago to get an empowerment zone if , .. if everyone .. were not supportive and on board . ... So , .. I mean that answers your question . I don't know what the coordinating council's role , .. in that case would be . ... But we'll .. definitely take that message back . ... on that question I- -- May I propose that the coordinating council consider , ... my .. individual worst case scenario , ... and any other worst case scenarios , that they .. collectively might come up with . ... Notwithstanding Paul 's suggestion , ... that the empowerment zone ... moneys , a hundred million , ... CTA green line , three-hundred million , ... be utilized , .. effectively and efficiently , ... to get a bigger bang for the buck . ... kay  , .. I just wanted to say that , .. there's also some other opportunities for , ... um , ... organizations that are new , .. in the networking process , and I think that the more meetings you can attend , and the more ... organizations , ... that hear your voice . .. the better . ... There's uh , ... a networking meeting going on , .. on Friday . ... at nine thirty in the morning , at the Mega Center . ... And it's .. free , ... It's it's a -- ... it's .. a group of assist and nonassist agencies , ... um , .. organizations like CRCC , ... the Mega Center , the COBCU , .. Women's Business Development Center , ... all Business Development Center , I couldn't even begin to mention the list , because there's about twenty-five different assist and nonassist agencies on there . ... But I think that , .. anybody who belongs to an organization , ... um , ... that ... has any type of .. connection with the city , .. it would be good to -- Twenty-sixth where . .. This one is Friday , ... at nine thirty at the Mega Center . ... The bank , right ? That's the bank . ..  ..  -- It's one o five West Adams , ... on the seventh floor , ... At what time ? ... Nine . ... I'm sorry , it's nine to tenthirty . ... Okay , I- I- .. I- I have a clue that she gave me , but I'll ... make arrangements on it . Mhm . ... The lady in the yellow sweater ? Actually I was -- ... again I was trying to reframe his concerns in the best case scenario . The Alderman spoke to , ... you feel that , somehow the process that has been established . ... Um , .. could divide the city . .. Best case scenario would be the- nan , .. provisions were made , ... such that the ideas that come out , and the collaborations that come out of this process , ... and let them .. continue . Whether or not the city of Chicago is designated for anything . .. That- .. that some reassurance of what comes out of it , could be , um , somehow taken into consideration , and continue to be fostered , ... from the city of Chicago , .. I think the city is -- .. I mean I know the city is committed to that , and I know that that has come up at the i- um , .. the coordinating council meeting . A desire to work , ... continue to work , ... with people , .... no matter what happens , on this issue , and there's been some discussion about , um , ... other kinds of funds , that could be .. put towards implementing , uh , .. uh , .. areas -- .. plans in areas that are not selected , um , so I think there is a commitment to do that , and that -- .. that certainly has been the spirit , of the um .. coordinating council . ... You , and then Paul . Um , ... I've got uh .. three questions .. for you . Uh , ... and I suppose your response is gonna just .. kinda  on there , but first , .. um , .. does the city have any idea how many uh , ... requests they're gonna- -- how many proposals that they're gonna be getting ? ... Do you have an estimation ? No . ... So , At least one .  ((LAUGHTER) I'm sure . Um , s- --  ... Uh well that kind of leads into my- -- .. my next question I think touches on .. these people's questions , as far as , ... it seemed like it would behoove us all , if there were some kind of .. consensus building process before , ... uh , .. this went on and , ... So what people are saying , they're having community meetings , .. community organiza- -- .. -- .. community , uh , .. group meetings . .. But , ... uh , ... it's -- ... from what I understand of this empowerment zone .. process , the idea is to really .. involve things on a g- grassroots level . (COUGH) ... And , ... my two concerns on par- -- as far as participation goes , .. are one , ... that , ... a- and I voiced this concern with elder Jarret when , .. uh last month at the , ... uh , .. Washington- -- or uh Washington Library Center when they , ... uh ,  the person introduced that . ... And , ... that is , ... simply ... throwing this out into the community and saying that , ... you expect the community to be able to respond , .. Community groups to be able to respond to you . Is , ... I think it- at l- at least , not an effective , ... uh instrument for -- for getting this done . ... Uh , ... I think that that's the expectation of the -- It doesn't -- it doesn't address -- of the  . None It doesn't address the fact that , .. one , .. community organizations , .. um , and many are- .. of them being service providers , .. do not necessarily have , ... the same ... goals ? .. in mind , as community residents do . They've got different agendas , they've got different .. priorities , they've got different .. purposes . ... than , ... members of the r- the community themselves . ... Um , ... the second thing is that , .. people who do not live , .. directly inside , the areas that are gonna be part of the empowerment zones , ... they've got an overriding concern in this because , as Mr Pollack said , A hundred million dollars is just gonna be a drop in the bucket . ... To be able to make these things work , and especially to make them work over a ten year process , that this is calling for , ... there're gonna be a lot of community ... resources , .. s- -- .. uh , ... from the federal government , ... from the state , ... county , ... and city , that are gonna need to be .. marshalled , they're gonna need to be , .. reallocated to this area . ... And to be able to have a consensus , not just within .. the empowerment zone , but within the city itself , if these services . ... Are gonna be provided and maintained , ... over the ten years , ... through different administrations , ... through different aldermen , ... political processes , .. involved , ... these people are not being brought into the decision-making process beforehand . ... And I think this speaks to these people's concern , that -- These people meaning who . .. The -- I I heard several people , this .. this r- -- ... I don't know their names . So I'll just have to -- .. woman in yellow , ... gentleman here in the glasses , that , ... there's gonna be h , .. uh earlier that very first speaker , gentleman uh , Ed ith . ... Uh , ... that you're gonna be receiving a number of ... proposals , ... and , ... you say you don't know how many , I don't know how you're gonna have , ... twenty-eight .. thirty-two people that you said , on a coordinating council read , ... maybe a hundred proposals , ... within a week's time , ... and be able to ... arrive at one ... selected empowerment zone , ... it seems to me that it- .. be much more beneficial , .. if the entire community as a whole , ... was brought into this process , .. and , ... this is what I'm bringing up is , the idea of participation . ... TRUE community-based citizen participation . ... would involve ongoing series of meeting , ... that I would think that the ... coordinating council would be ... promoting , .. would be organizing and directing on an ngoing even nightly basis , (COUGH) (COUGH) (COUGH) .. That's not exactly grassroot ... planning , to be -- either . Right . um , ... grassroot planning , is when people get out in the community , and organize , ... But they need a forum . and do the work . they need -- if this woman here today did not speak up , and , Let me answer your question . All these people here would not even know a meeting was going on . Let me 4.. try to respond to your question sir . ... So , .. what you're suggesting is not a grassroot , in my opinion , a grassroot ... process . Secondly , the the the reality is , ... we only have , ... till June thirtieth to submit an application . .. A really -- ... a TRUE strategic planning process , grassroot , .. takes many more months than that . ... Many more years than we have .  .. Okay ? So , we have to do the best that we .. can do , given the time that we have . ... And all I'm saying is , I'm saying that , .. I don't believe a forum , is being presented for community groups to -- .. I mean , some people are finding out about this for the first time tonight , some people are finding out about meetings , that are going on with other groups , for the first time tonight , this is not being promoted by the city , this is not being publicized as a forum .. as a -- It has been promoted , it has been publicized . I don't know -- I'll tell you right now , that the leading , onprofit , .. affordable housing provider on the West Side , isn't even involved with this . He said he hasn't even  -- PRIDE . .. has not even been contacted , by those groups on the West Side . Well , let me tell you . I've worked with PRIDE , .. and I had a meeting with PRIDE last week , they know about it . I didn't say they didn't know about it , I said they're not being -- they're not being contacted by y- -- ... as far as being brought into a network , ... for this . I'm I'm sorry , I'm not trying to be confrontational . Okay , I'm trying to raise .. issues and concerns . Alright ? Although I do think , The second -- my second qu- -- that the organization , has a responsibility . .. If they're interested in this , Undoubtedly . Undoubtedly . And they care about empowerment of th- of their 3.. constituency , Undoubtedly . to get involved in the process , and find a way to make that happen  . M- my second question would be on the process , the city obviously's got its own priorities , it's got , ... um , ... funds already allocated in budget , it's got areas designated that they would like to see worked on , ... and , ... my question as far as the process is c- -- way the selection goes , .. are um , ... what -- w- which is gonna drive which . ... How much weight are gonna be given to , ... um , ... proposals , which .. dovetail into .. existing programs , that the city has , or , .. that the city is intending on implementing in certain areas , .. and how much is the city willing to bend and say , ... I will g- -- we are gonna forego ... these uh .. scheduled or proposed projects , to be able to dovetail into .. empowerment zones . ... What's being said , Patty is , ... when is the city going to present , say for instance , ... its overall plan , for conducting the city . So everyone can see , .. their seat , .. in the auditorium , .. or their .. place around the table , ... and how long will they have to wait for their turn for development , .. when will their interests be served , ... so , ... this empowerment zone , it simply seems to me , is opening a Pandora's Box . ... Go ahead . ... Well to -- let me answer your question in terms of the um , ... uh , ... proposed plans , .. I mean right now , ... the ... um coordinating council , is making the selection , based on the information , ... that is received from the community . ... And obviously there there are ... other issues to look at , .. for example , ... um , organizations that may be involved in .. um .. current work , ... their ability , new organizations , new ideas , I mean all that is getting- -- .. is thrown in the pot . and I don't think that any .. community that has an existing plan , .. has a leg up , ... on any one else who has a new idea that may not be part of a plan . ... Uh , .. are they explaining the uh- -- for example I -- .. don't know if Londa White is here , s- uh theoretical- -- ... at a uh , ... a .. uh community meeting last month , in which uh a lot of uh selection criteria were , ... uh , ... drawn up , I was wondering , if is the council ... gonna absorb that into the selection process also , The council , has uh , received a copy of that , and the council has seen portions of uh , ... of the Seaway principles , some of those principles have been -- .. are included in what we have tonight , (COUGH) .. Others are really principles , for the zone itself , and how the makeup of the zone will be . ... And that is going to be handed out to the uh .. Coordinating Council , this Thursday . ... Uh , .. m- m- my third question is on the final program ? ... I- .. think this gentleman again spoke very , .. very adequately to it , .. um , .. it seems to me , again , ... this idea of building consensus . ... That , .. if we're able to make this -- a program like this work , over .. such a long time . ... That the city -- .. and in fact it's stated in the uh , ... uh , proposal , the uh .. HUD ... application proposal that , ... the uh , ... governing body , ... making the application , .. must provide a- .. NAME? and evidence , that this uh , ... uh empowerment zone plan , is gonna be adhered to and implemented , and it seems to me that , ... one of the ... most fundawen- .. fundamental and best ways to have this done , ... would be for the city to come up with a comprehensive plan , (COUGH) (COUGH) .. that follows guidelines , that would ... ensure , ... that what's happening in the empowerment zone , is indeed the seed program that's gonna be followed , and be able to be dis- ... distributed to other areas of the city and , ... and built on in other areas of the city , .. does the city have .. any , ... uh , ... plans , uh any any ... hope of , .. coming up with a comprehensive plan , for developing the city ? ... We do not have a comprehensive plan for .. the city of Chicago . ... Does the city have nan .. We have nan nan any hopes of , nan policies for development , .. and we have been identifying places , ... that have plans , .. and .. trying to get things done . A comprehensive plan , requires , uh , .. the infusion of .. many many dollars , .. much more than is available , ... you know , .. within the city budget , to implement a plan , ... and , at this point , we are looking at , ways to be strategic , ... in how we invest our money , ... and the empowerment zone is an e is an example , ... of an of an area where we are going to .. do some strategic planning along with the community , which will lead to implementation , and investing in our plan . ... Correct . Would you say it's only , ... we only have policy guidelines . and when- -- .. when administrations change , .. policies change . ... What I'm talking about is that , ... cities that we are competing against , Seattle , .. San Antonio , Minneapolis , .. they've got , ... comprehensive plans , for the development of their cities . ... And , that -- some of them do and some of them do not . The ones that I just mentioned do . nan .. Alright ? And , .. my point is , Some of them do , that , and some of them do not . ... The ones that I just mentioned do . ... And , .. my -- ... my point is , ... that , it seems to us that , it- it- .. it seems to me that , it would give us as .. Chicago , a much better footing with government , if we said , that we had a comprehensive plan , that was gonna ensure , .. that these things are going to be , .. Well sir ,    considering that our plan is due June thirtieth , and considering that between now and then , we will not have a comprehensive plan , for the city of Chicago , um , ... I'm not quite sure where to go with your question . .. ... Oh I'm s- -- .. I'm sorry , Oh , .. go ahead . go ahead . .. Bernie . I- ha- -- .. I just wanted to make a friendly .. remind .   I'm sorry Derek . Um , .. My name's Derek Williams , I'm -- .. I'm with the HORN association of men , .. and uh , ... I I think we need to recognize that uh , ... uh this is an opportunity , and it's not a threat . ... Uh , ... consensus do not build themselves . .. And , and if we just be perfectly honest with each other , ... the only reason that we're all in this room is because we heard , .. about a hundred million dollars . And that's what everybody's worried about . ... Uh , ... it's impossible for any city to have a comprehensive plan , because we don't have comprehensive people . ... First of all . ... And I think we just need to , ... given the information that's out there , ... we need to try to make it as meaningful as we can to our constituents . ... Uh , ... be honestly speaking with you , ... uh I come from an organization with ... five hundred members , ... and empowerment zone has .. absolutely no meaning , ... to just about eighty percent of our population . ... For the simple reason , ... we get caught up in , ... in in all of the rhetoric , .. um , .. we we constantly challenge each other , and I- -- I don't think this is the time for that . ... I I think we should be trying to focus on , ... the information that's available , ... and and and meet the challenge . And I and I think we can do that . .. And in -- .. and again , this is an opportunity , ... to .. meet the challenge . .. APPLAUSE ... Thanks Derek , that's why I guess you're sitting in the front row .  Um Paul . ... Derek I -- ... I appreciate following you . .. Thanks . ... Well see I'd've been kinda ... frustrated , trying to say what you said , some of it . ... I'd like to , just for a couple minutes , ... set the record straight , on what empowerment zones are , ... and what they are not , ... according to my own ... understanding . ... The empowerment zones , ... were ... implemented . ... under the Clinton administration . ... They did not start ... under the Clinton administration . ... They started in the state of Illinois , ... as enterprise zones , back in the eighties . ... The difference between .. empowerment zones , ... and enterprise zones , is that the federal government , ... for twelve years , .. Congress never did approve , ... enterprise zones , .. at the federal level . ... By the time they were approved , ... Congress , in its wisdom , ... attached ... funding . ... criteria . ... and shifted the name from enterprise zones , ... to empowerment zones . ... For the record . ... I do not live .. in CHA . ... I am not ... homeless . ... I do not .. transport myself , ... on CTA properties . ... I'm a veteran , .. so I do not go ... to county hospitals . ... I abide by the law , ... so I'm not in .. county jail . ... I have ... attended .. several colleges , ... I think successfully , ... they think .. unsuccessfully , ... so I do not need .. the public education system , ... in Chicago . ... But , ... I do know , who does .. need em . ... The homeless , ... and people not in .. public housing . ... Public housing , ... because one , .. we're getting ready , to tear them all down . ... What are we gonna do with it . ... The city .. has no right , ... would be in a fight , ... we need , ... to try and tell me , ... what my block needs , ... When my block decides , .. what it needs , ... and presents its plan , ... to the city , ... then the city , .. can take its logical , ... legal , ... jurisprudence , ... course , ... of identifying , ... what .. resources it has , .. and make em available . ... The empowerment zones , ... what are , .. by legislation , ... to be planned , ... by , ... with , ... and for , ... those most in need of empowering . ... It don't mention , ... those agencies , .. most in need . This is not the entitlement programs . See the entitlement programs is what has turned the West Side , into a damn desert .. of oasis and poverty . ... Because the West Side was planned .. for . ... CHA was planned .. for . ... The city .. has put together in a aggregate sum , the map that is about two pages , that shows you where the poorest folks live . ... If you are an agency , ... that is involved in those areas , ... take the opportunity to find out what those people need , .. and deliver the proposal . ... If you are an agency that is outside of those areas , of the census track , that each of you have , ... then , .. change your location , ... do like Reagan said , ... and move with your feet .. into the area . ... This is no , you know , three card Molly here . ... We already know , .. where the most empower- .. NAME? .. people .. are . ... Get busy . ... Patty asked a question earlier . ... I have .. chose not to do it , ... but out of necessity , ... I'm gonna ask you to .. walk through this , ... this is where the poor folks live . ... This is where your tax dollars are going . And this is why you get upset , every time the city launches a project , because you say , .. it comes in over budget . ... This is where the state .. has roads going on . ... This is where county hospital has roads going on . So as far as I'm concerned , if the city did anything more than what it was doing , I would file a grievance with the Department of Justice , to say that they were in violation .. of the legislation . ... The legislation says that , .. those who have nothing , ... are either to be courted .. by those who have something , or left alone . ... so that they can develop , .. their own plan , and be responsible for their success , ... or their failure . ... That to me .. is the empowerment zone . ... Anything else , .. is a contradiction , ... Malcolm  , we .. sitting in the college named after him , he said by whatever means necessary . So by whatever means necessary it takes for you to get gautonomous , touched , .. contagious , in in love with ... poor folks . ... is what is gonna take , .. to keep your agencies , ... empowered . ... APPLAUSE Thank you Paul . Um , .. before we close , we have uh several members of the Coordinating Council here , who I'd like to recognize , and see if they ... want to add anything , before we .. leave uh .. here tonight . Um , ... we have Sproule White , who is the executive director of the Chicago Jobs Council , ... um , .. Wanda White , who is the executive director of the Community Workshop on Economic Development , (COUGH) and Ted Wysaki , who is the executive director of , .. uh , CANDO , the Chicago Association of Neighborhood Development .. Organizations , and also , Frank Grosan was here , from Continental Bank . .. And also the chair of the capital improvement advisory committee . ... Do you wanna say anything ? ... Okay . ... I'll just ... make one point , and I'll make it brief , and that is , ... Cool . .. Alright folks . ... Well alreet , well alroot , well alright . By now I'm sure you're wondering about the different things that I have on the table here , but first , ... I would like to .. talk to you about these three items . I have here , some ice in a pan , water in this glass , .. and steam rising from this pot . .. Now . ... I would like to ask you , how these three things . .. Tell me please . How are they all alike . ... These three things . This ice here in this pan . This water in this glass , and the steam rising from this pot , just yell it out , we are informal here , yes . .. Correct . ... They are all forms of water . This ice here of course is water , I told you there was water in this glass , .. and you have all seen water boil at home , so you are familiar with steam . But now let's try to figure out how they're different , we'll look at temperature , first . And the temperature of this water here , the ice , .. is , ... about uh twenty-four- -- nwoo . Nineteen degrees . Very cold . The temperature of this w- water here , is sixty-four degrees , the temperature of this steam , is , ... I know it's hotter than that . ... Yeah , it's about a hundred and eleven degrees . ... Okay .  Fahrenheit . ... Okay . Oh , and by the way guys , what do we call something that's hard , like this ice here , or a table , or a rock . We call it a ? ... Solid . Very good . You should g- -- you should be a choir . .. You should go out on the road there , like , ... yeah . .. We are .  Y- -- ... Oh well , .. I'm glad to meet you .  Please give me your itinerary after the show . Yes . Yes . ... Of course we call it a sholids . A solid . And a solid has one shape . The shape that it starts out with .  And what do we call something that you- -- .. that you can splish splash . Take a bath in . Anything wet like soda or milk . Liquid . You're not gonna let me finish , are you . Yes , we call it a , ... Liquid . Very good . And a liquid .. can change its shape , .. to f- completely fill the bottom of whatever container you put it in . And finally , what do we call something that's loose , and floating around like this steam here . Or a cloud or the air we breathe , we call it a , Gas . Correct . a gas . And a gas completely fills whatever shape container you put it in . And so , how do you get water to change , from a solid , to a liquid , .. to a gas , ... and back and forth . Add energy . Woo . I like the way he expressed that . Never before have I heard it , add .. or subtract energy , or , heat , .. change the temperature , basically . Correct ? ... Alright . Well folks , now I'm going to show you something else that happens . When you change the temperature , and that's where these balloons come in . I have here , a number of balloons , but , l- let's see how many of these balloons , I can fit , into this little itty-bitty container here . Well , ... everybody count together . This would be , There's a  in there . you think , .. well , ... okay , w th- th , I'm glad I never saw d- Citizen Cane with you , ... Rosebud is a sled . Okay . Well ,  let's all count together folks , that was , ... One . One .  very good . One balloon going into the little container here . And this would be , Two . two . Very good counting there . Two . Excellent . Two balloons going into the little container here .  Ah , they're not fitting in so easily . Oh no . So hopefully I can fit all balloons into this little container here .     Oh stop guessing at what this is .  ... Let's have some suspense here . Come on .  Alright . And this would be ? ... Three . Three . Very good . Three balloons going onto the the ... little container there . Three balloons . .. Three , yes , the balloon trinity . And now , ... this would be ? Eight . ...  Four . Four . Very good . At first he was confused , but then he figured it out . Everybody tell him what this is , it's , ... Seven . it's four . ..  .. Boy you people .. didn't watch enough Sesame Street as a child . This would be , ... Five . Thank you very much , yes . Five swollen balloons . In . In . Down . ... Down . Ah , ... ah . Okay . And this .. would be ? ... Six . Six , good . And let's do this uh , let's add some complexities to this here , let's do it in another language . In Spanish it would be ? .. Ocho None . None Seis None .  ... S- seis . N- Ocho . Oh my gosh .  I'm afraid for our nation . Okay , well , ... and this would be , ... Siete . thank you . ... Seven . Right ? Seven . Okay . And finally , this would be , ... Eight . None Ocho None . eight , or ocho in Spanish , ... and uh huit in French , thank you very much . I thought you were telling me your breakfast . What you had for b- -- But no , Huit . .. Very good . .. Oh my gosh , ... eight balloons into this little container here , .. I bet you're wondering r- how that happened , You popped two . ... There's a hole in it .  well , ... there's a hole , no , if you're thinking there's a hole , think again . Because , there's no hole in the counter at all .  Pull em out . You slowed down the molecules , Well- la- duh- dah- dih- duh- duh , .. you're getting a little ahead of me son . ..  ... Let's all figure it out together . You popped them .  And we can get a better idea of what's happening to the balloons , if we go back and look at the water again . No I did not pop them . You're -- What- y- what -- .. Y- -- Do you heckle every scientific person . .. This is really terrible . I'm gonna take some of this hot water here , and pour it into this flask here . ... And put a balloon over the top .. of the flask . ... Ah . ... Alright ? And now , I will heat up this water . Using , ... my Bunsen burner . ...  ... Does it use real Bunsen ? Is that what you're asking me ? Alright here we go . ... There we go . ... Alright , I'm using the fire now to heat up the water , but let's behave like scientists now , .. and .. watch , and observe , and take note of what we see . Okay ? Now . ... Folks . ... What do we see . Well if we look very closely , we can see , .. condensation here . ... On the sides of this flask , and steam . ... Rising up from the water . Going up into the balloon , making .. the balloon .. blow up . ... Woo , don't want too much heat there . Oh we can also start to see bubbles in the water . The water that was sitting at the bottom of this flask , turned into a gas . That had enough force , to fill up this balloon . ... That's what we call boiling folks , and I'm sure you do too . Turning from a liquid into .. a gas . ... Now if I took the t- balloon , .. if I took the balloon off the top of this flask here , and put the water into the freezer , .. what do you think would happen to the water . ... It would freeze and turn into a ? ... Solid . Solid , correct . .. But it would still be water . Yes you're right . ... Whether it's a solid , a liquid , or a gas . So let's think about what water is made up of . Well water is made up of .. atoms . .. Yeah . Everything is made up of atoms . Solids , liquids , .. gasses . Now in water , two atoms of what ato- uh .. element ? Yes ? .. Hydrogen . Very good , hydrogen , and , ... one atom of what ? .. Oxygen . .. Oxygen . .. I know you wanted to say it , but .. he's my pet . Okay ? .. None  None ,  A- all these atoms .. combine to form .. a molecule of water . And that's what a molecule is folk . A group of atoms , hanging out . .. Having a good time together . And they call the water molecule .. aich two o . .. Alright . So . ... Folks . .. How do you suppose the molecules in this water , goodbye guys , I -- I'll miss you . ..    How do you suppose the molecules in this water when it's ice , are different from the molecules in the water when it's a liquid , and different still from the water -- .. from the molecules in the water when it's steam . Fast . ... Do you know ? ... .. Yes ? They're not moving  .  That's right , it's th- -- it's movement my friends . You see , all molecules move . Not just in water , but in everything in the universe . Even you . The molecules are moving . But to get a better understanding of how those molecules interact , let's pretend these ping-pong balls here are molecules . Well folks . In a solid , like this ice here . Or a table . The molecules are moving  very slowly . MACHINESTARTS Alright ? ... And they're very close together , .. in fact .. they're in a v- .. joined uniform state . .. Okay , they move very coolly , .. slowly , and that's what it's like , in a solid . Like the ice . But in a liquid , .. the molecules are moving a little more quickly . ... Okay ? So you have some .. fluidity of movement within a fixed volume . Okay , they're a little more .. further apart there , .. but in a gas , ... look at that . They're moving very quickly indeed . Alright ? They're moving so fast they completely fill the shape container , ... . MACHINESTOPS .. That's what it's like in a gas . ... And temperature is a measurement of how fast .. or slow molecules are moving . So if you have slow moving molecules , what temperature do you have people . ... ... Yes , .. cold , or low temperature . And if you have fast moving molecules , what type of temperature do you have . ... Hot . Hot or high temperature . You're right . But not every substance becomes , a solid , a liquid , and a gas , at the same temperatures , as water does . And that brings us back to the mystery of our disappearing balloons . Now inside this container here , into which our balloons , ah , I am losing my ... spheres . ... Inside this container , into which our balloons have disappeared , I have a liquid . I'm going to take some of that liquid , and examine it much in the same way that I did the water . ...  ... Yeah . Alright guys . Let's watch now and see what occurs . I'm going to pour this liquid into this flask here , ... .. and again , we will behave like scientists , and watch , and observe , and see what we ... notice . .. Now here ... is a liquid . ... That is bubbling and steaming , like the water was , when there were the f- -- .. when there was a flame underneath it . But , there's no flame underneath this .. liquid here . ... Nthat's different . .. Let's see , .. what happens when I put a balloon over the top . ... If we do in fact have a liquid , that's turning into a gas , with enough force to fill up a balloon , and lo and behold , we do . It is filling up the balloon here . .. But . ... ... This steam here is very cold . And we can see that frost is forming , on the sides of this flask here . .. Frost ? .. My God . That's curious . Let's see what the temperature is of this liquid . ..  Did you guys come from a deprived home or something , you didn't have balloons ?  Fighting over balloons . I never thought I'd see the day . I'm going to put this probe here into this liquid , and we will see what temperature this balloon is . Uh try to .. stay in your seats , I don't want you guys to run up .. throughout the show . ... Okay , now the temperature of this liquid is , three-hundred and twenty-three degrees below zero . Water becomes a solid at thirty-two degrees above zero . And it remains a solid at every tenjure- temperature below that . So , folks , do you think , this .. three-hundred and twenty-three degree liquid , ... is .. water . .. No . No . That's right , go ahead and shake your heads in disbelief . Of course it's not water . No . This .. folks .. is .. liquid nitrogen . .. Ah yes . ... Where folks can you find ... lots of nitrogen . ... In -- He's like , .. oing this . I thought he had bad breath , yes , ... the air you're breathing right now . Your lungs are filled with this stuff , all of you . ... The air is probably about seventy percent nitrogen , and uh , .. it's oxygen , and other gasses as well , okay ? .. Our body takes it all in . But we only use the oxygen . We breathe out the nitrogen . The reason why the nitrogen is not freezing our lungs , as it is doing this flask here , is because , those molecules are moving much faster . The .. nitrogen is warmer . Probably about seventy degrees I would imagine . But , ... this ... liquid .. is very cold indeed . Three-hundred and twenty-three degrees below zero . Well , ... to get exactly , ... to get an idea about how cold that is , let's use these two ... bouncing rubber balls . I would like you people in the audience to , examine the balls . ... To let me know if , .. they are in fact , ... average normal everyday balls . ... Testify for the audience . Don't bite into it , jeesh .   .. You've really haven't been fed , have you . Oh I'm really feeling sorry for you . Please bounce it back now . ... No , don't bounce it .   Throw it anywhere else .  Throw it in the water . .. Right under the water . That was -- .. I'm surprised I caught that . Normally I'm .. ftry to goof . I'm like Michael Jordan , in the White Sox . But anyway , but this time I caught it . So , let's see what happens , when one of these balls goes into the liquid nitrogen . Now the other one stays out here , with me . ... Where it's nice and warm .  ... Well let's think now about what's happening to this ball . ... It's in the very cold liquid nitrogen . Right ? So . .. What do you think is happening to the ball . Is the ball getting hotter or colder . Everybody say it out loud . Hotter . .. Colder . Colder . Okay , ... some people don't agree with you . .. In fact most people don't .  Yes , it's getting colder . So if the ball is getting colder , do you think the ball's molecules , are going faster ? ... Or slower . Slower . Slower , okay . And that .. you all .. concur . That is excellent . So , if these molecules are going slower , do you think -- ... and the ball is getting colder , do you think the ball is becoming more of a solid ? .. Or more of a liquid . What do you think . .. Liquid . A liquid , only one person thinks that , cause everybody didn't want to go all that far out on a limb . So let's see , .. if uh , sh- -- if what this guy is thinking is TRUE . If it becomes more of a liquid , or more of a solid . I will take this ball out of the liquid nitrogen , and we will begin ... the experiments . Okay , now . ... Let's see , ... they look alike , don't they , they still look .. pretty much the same , except we have steam coming off this ball here , let's see if they bounce .. as before . ... Well this one .. m- .. bounces pretty much the same , but this one is different . That is curious . Hmm . Well I must continue my study . Let's see how they react under ... pressure . ... Okay , alright , this one .. pretty much .. is absorbing my energy , it remains intact , but let's see what happens to this ball . ...    ...   ..  Did it break ? ... No . It broke . ... You see , these molecules got slower and slower and slower , and , closer together . The ball became more of a solid than before , it became harder .  .. Well folks , that .. kinda k- -- it .. gives you a little bit of an idea of what's happening to our balloons , but it still doesn't make it absolutely clear , so . ... And we'll see what happens to this ... big old balloon . .. When it interacts with liquid nitrogen . ... Alright ? ... Rather than see what happens tha- there and- -- .. guess at what's happening to these .. balloons in the container , we will see what happens to a balloon , when it interacts with liquid nitrogen in the light of day . ... Alright , I'm pouring the very cold liquid nitrogen over this balloon . .. So the balloon and its contents , the air inside , is getting colder and colder and colder . Okay those molecules are slowing down . They're going slower and slower , and so they're getting closer and closer together . Okay ? You still have the same number of air molecules inside this balloon , as you did before . .. It's just that , they're going slower , so they're closer together , and they take up less space , in this balloon . ... And look .. at the balloon . At the very bottom of it . You can see a liquid . .. That's the air people . How often do you get to see liquified air , but that is the air . .. The molecules have gotten so .. slowed down , and so close together that , they're less , .. they're not in the .. as much in the form of a gas now , they're more in the form ... of a liquid . But now . .. The air around it , is causing those molecules to speed up . ...  Ha ha . .. And so , ... the molecules are speeding up , they're getting further and further apart , .. and taking up more space inside the balloon , so the balloon goes back to its former size and shape . So that has to be what's happening to the balloons , that are inside this container here . Alright ? ... Yes , these balloons are in the very cold liquid nitrogen , and so those molecules slowed down , and got closer together , the air , ... took up less space inside the balloons . So I can fit all those balloons , into this little itty-bitty container . .. But now , I'm taking the balloons out .. of this container , so the molecules .. are speeding up . The air is heating up , .. okay ? .. And so the molecules are going faster and faster , and they're getting further and further apart , ... they're taking up less space , ... insi -- I'm sorry , taking .. up more and more space , inside these balloons . .. .. And you might want to protect your eardrums . Cause sometimes as these balloons expand , they pop . And let me tell you , ... I get quite shell shocked at the end of the day . .. So , ... this really teaches us a lot people , this tells us that the difference -- ((POP) Ow . .. The difference in a substance between a solid .. a liquid and a gas , .. .. like water , is , ... how fast the molecules are moving . And that different ... substances become a solid , ... a liquid , .. and a gas at different temperatures , and temperature is a measurement of how fast or slow molecules are moving . .. That's what I wanted to tell you people , I love to share that with everyone that I meet , if you have any questions about this , or .. any other subject , come on up and ask , .. even if you don't , .. I certainly hope you have a great day here at the Museum ... of Science ... and Industry .  Oh , ...  .. thank you very much . Oy . .. Someone's been shot . ...  ... RING ... RING ... Hello , .. How's my favorite girl in the world . Hey .. baby . .. Who's -- Who's the girl that .. I love ?  Who's the girl that I'll do anything for ?  ..  I'll wash her feet with my mouth .  Aw honey  ,  how are you .  after a ten mile run . Ew . ..  I would . .. Ew . I would . Ew .   How are you , .. honey ? None  I'm doing good .   I miss you . None     I miss you too .  ... Hm . How's my favorite girl .  .. I'm good . Is she -- Is she okay ? Unhunh . Are you guys having fun ? Yes . ... I'm so glad . Aw ,  ...  m ,    What are you going into purr mode ?   3..  Oh , .. gosh , we kept missing you . Hunh . I know , it's been a while . Last night , and today , It's been a long time .  It's been so long . ... I know . You missed like all the drama here . ..  No drama . Yeah , there was such drama . There was drama , and there was suspense . And then there was relief , and then there was ecstasy .  ... No .  Well , I'll -- Not the ecstasy .  Ecstasy of sorts . None -- Wait , tell me what -- Well see I , The reas- -- I have --  I kinda , ... I wasn't inclined to .. call you ? Unhunh . Because I just wanted to give you and Jill your time . .. Yeah . You know ? 2.. Like I felt like , ... Totally .  .. you know , so that's -- .. I let -- There were a couple times when I wanted to call you , and I didn't for that reason . Uh , .. Unhunh . Aw thanks . .. Yeah , well the thing was , .. I hadn't told you ? .. But my period is really late . ... You know ? And I guess , .. we would talk , and then we'd hang up , and then I thought , oh , gosh , I forgot to tell you .  But -- I've been meaning to ask you about that . Really ? You were getting nervous -- You haven't had it yet ?  No . ... I mean , .. and it's been so .. long . And so it's like .. eight days late ? And I thought , I'm sure I'm pregnant . I'm .. positive . And I was waiting till Jill got here ? That's bad . .. to even .. try 2.. to 2.. check ? Oh . .. Yeah ?  .. And .. um , so we went .. to go get .. an EPT . ... at- .. pregnancy test . Yeah . And then .. we d -- That's why we were calling you last night . .. You know ?  What happened . .. And then , ..  of course it came out fine . So that's the -- It came out negative ? Yeah , so that's the relief and the ecstasy . .. So , .. y- you can't be pregnant . .. No . .. I don't -- .. No . Unless it was a FALSE negative .  which .. I doubt . Because --  That's rare . Right ? .. Right . .. I think that would be really rare . ... So , ... th .. you know what I mean , like can , ... would it come out nega- -- Let's say i- i f you were pregnant , in its early st , early early stages ? .. Mhm . Like wo , .. Like would a negative ? .. You know what I'm saying ?   M . Like could you get -- Is it possible that you could still be posi- .. positive ? .. I think .. there'd be a slight chance , .. of it being a FALSE .. negative . .. But , .. I don't think so , cause I'm pretty late ? And I think I'm late enough , where I would have , .. like , .. enough of .. the hormone that .. the pregnancy test tests for ? I think I would have enough of that in my urine , that .. of course it would show up . .. if I had any in there ? .. Yeah ?  You know ? So I -- I I'm pret- -- I took that as a pretty good sign . ... Oh my god . You know . Honey , how come you've been .. keeping all this inside .  I know , .. I didn't mean to keep it inside .  . I mean- -- I didn't mean -- Don't you love me ? Oh  . Aw . I didn't mean to not tell you at all . It was just , we would hang up the phone , then I thought , oh yeah , I forgot to mention that I'm kinda late . Cause I didn't think it was a .. huge deal , but then , ... I guess I wasn't trying . ... I think I was in a .. bit of denial . Like I wasn't really thinking about it much . You know , cause I knew once Jill got here , then .. I would go get the test . .. So is that all the drama ? That was the drama . And that was the suspense , and that .. was the relief , and that was the ecstasy . .. Really ? Unhunh . .. Oh , honey .  Oh . Little bunny is going through the .. whole wide spectrum of emotions .  She's doing it without me .  She's going solo on this .  I'm going solo . This is Jillpan going solo .  I know ,  I thought it was so funny , last night , like .. what if it came back positive ? And then that would mean , the next time I talked to you , I'd be telling you that I was pregnant ? And then I thought gosh , poor Jeff , like I hadn't given you any like , .. you know , like I hadn't .. warned you , or anything . And it would have been such a surprise . .. Totally . I thought .. oh my gosh . I was even g- -- That would've been , gonna bring the camera into the bathroom , to take a picture of the EPT . Cause I thought ,  ...   -- .. you know , it's like such a momentous occasion , like what if it came out positive ,  and then I thought , of cour- -- Like I know I .. wouldn't .. have .. it or anything , but I thought if the slight chance .. I would have it , and it really became a person someday , wouldn't they love to see .. the photograph of the EPT ,  with the positive sign on it ? ... Knowing that .. that was like its first sign of life . Unhunh . Oh my g-   .  I know it's kind of --  2..  Kind of 2.. spooky .  It's not my idea of a good time right now sweetie .  Oh , sorry .     Maybe somewhere down the road , but right now it kind of makes me sick . None  Right , I know I know ,  me too . Me too .  I was very --  ,   But it was just a thought that went through my head .   No that's a very cute thought .   Cho- -- Let's chock that up as a very cute thought  You know me and cameras .   Aw honey .   Aw , so how are you . .. Know what's even better ? .. What . .. You could do like a selftimer . ... A selftimer ?  .. With you right next to it ?  A self- -- You go , .. I'm the mom , ...  you know ? .. Oh gosh . Next to the result ?  Oh gosh .   Right . And I could even send it to EPT . .. Yeah .   Use it for advertising .  In fact I could send it to you , cause I have it . .. The .. test right there . Aw . Anyhow . .. So how are you . Nothing  , outside of that . Good . Good , we had such a nice day . It's really beautiful here . .. It's like -- It is ? Unhunh . Like seventy degrees , and sunny , and ,  we walked around , we went to a park , and we just .. talked , and talked , and sat in the sun , and , .. we had such a nice day . ... We went out for dinner with Joy . ... Aw , what a joy . We just got back here , ..  great , so you've been relaxing . Unhunh . Do you have school ? ... Yeah , well I had school on Friday . .. Oh I see . .. Yeah and I have it on Monday too . .. Gotcha .  Yeah . Wh- Jill's leaving .. tomorrow ? Unhunh , she's leaving tomorrow night . ... Aw ,  So you guys have been having a good time . Unhunh , such a good time . It's so good to see her . Staying up late , .. Unhunh .  -- We stayed up till like three thirty last night . .. What are you guys doing . Talking or something ? Just talking .  Just talking ?  .. Just talking ?    We have a lot to catch up on . I know . I know . I'm just kidding . What have you been up to . .. Nothing . .. Nothing ? .. Just homework . .. Yeah ? I just played basketball at Main Beach . .. Oh . I- and I .. just talked to this ... Asian guy , um , who's twenty- NAME? years old , and , ... he's a very sweet guy , he just moved to Laguna .  Unhunh . And , .. we just , .. we just got in one of those .. conversations where  , .. you just talk about everything .  Unhunh . Like , like real political , and , and , .. everything from Norm- -- um , Norm Nixon ,  that's a basketball player .    I said Norm , instead of like .. President .. Nixon ? Oh right . Yeah ,   from Nixon , to like Rush Limbaugh , to abortion , to capital punishment ,  Whoa . Like , .. yeah , you know what , and it's so funny , cause he's , .. he's a Catholic , ... and , you know , like I nailed him on the contradiction you know , he's like pro-capital punishment , ... but -- and .. prolife ?  Unhunh . I said try to explain that to me , I don't understand . Wait , he said he's .. pro-capital punishment , and prolife ?  and prolife . Right . None That's like , to me that's like a huge contradiction ? ... And , he said , M . he d- he justified it as , well see the , .. th- those little en , .. the little , ... um , .. embryos ? ... They don't have a .. decis- -- .. They can't make a decision . ... You know , and they're gonna die . This is what he was saying . Yeah , and he said that , you know , people who .. commit crimes , you know , that .. calls for the death penalty , .. they brought it upon themselves . ... Oh wait , .. Jeff , can you hang on just a sec ? Yes . What did you say ? I'm  gonna go over there . Oh you are ? Okay . Yeah . ... Okay , I'll come over . ... Um , Where's Jill going . .. She's going next door ? .. Who . To Robby's ? ... Oh .  Uh , Has she been clicking with your friends ? It's right there . .. Yeah we're gonna go hang out there . ... With who wh- who ?  .. We're gonna go .. hang out next door . at Robby's ? He's having some people over ? Oh Robby , with the kitty . .. Right . Robby with the kitty . Has Jill been --  My sweatshirt . My sweatshirt , I put it back ... in the closet . ..  M- -- Has Jill been digging your friends ? Unhunh . .. Yeah . We spent some ti- -- It's up on the , ... up folded . ... up there high . .. Yup . ... Um . ... Okay so uh ,  You can't talk to both of us at the same time . Okay , I'll come next door . .. Jilly's going next door . Bye Jill . Bye Jeff . ... She says bye . ... Um , .. yeah . She um , ... we hung out with Donna , and .. they hit it off . .. And , we went out to dinner with Joy .. tonight , .. and she's met everybody . ... Great . Yeah . How does um , ...  How's Jill . How's her state of mind . .. Does she seem ... at peace with herself ?  .. She happy ? .. Unhunh . .. Oh yeah . Yeah ? She seems really good . .. Yeah ?  Unhunh . ... Okay now , tell me the stuff that she doesn't want ... you to tell me .  Now that she's gone . Now's the chance . Yeah because , y- remember , ... you're my .. girlfriend , before you're her friend .  Jeff .      Oh .   .. Oh sweetie .  Remember , 4..  .. you're gonna spend the rest of your life with me .  ..

Come on sweetie ,  Come on honey . ..  None Let it out like a good girl .   Like a good girl .   Jeff ,   oh , ... no I won't . You're such a little giggly monster . ..    Y- -- Just .. when I talk to you .    You just -- neyou need to be cuddled . .. Aw . You need to be squeezed , and caressed , and loved .  ... Aw , I miss you . .. You do ? .. Yes . .. Aw , I miss you too . ... M .   Know what Rob's doing ? What . Rob ... decided that he just needed a vacation or something ? Unhunh . So nan , ... he .. took off for .. Big Bear . ... You're kidding . Had no idea where he was going , he just took -- All by himself ? All by himself , and , he found a cabin , he called me ? Mhm . He found a cabin , like overlooking , .. um , .. Big Bear Lake , ... You're kidding . And , it's like , just the cabin with like , .. four beds in it . ... But , you know , cause nobody's up there now ? Unhunh . So he got it for fifty-five bucks a night , .. and he's staying there for a few nights . So -- All by himself ? All by himself , he just wants to be up in the mountains , he wants to write , and just , .. you know , ... just , you know , get in tune with him- .. with himself . Wow , did he want you to go with him ?  ... Oh no , I couldn't go . Oh . .. Yeah I think he was trying to get a girl to go with him but ,  Oh ,  but that fell through .  So he went from like the romantic .. sexual getaway , to ,  you know , a soul searching .. bond with nature .. type of deal . Right ,  .. aw , I hope he's not disappointed  . I know  .   Oh , no ,  that sounds .. great . I mean that sounds , ... You know , .. it r- .. reminds me of us . good opportunity . ... Mhm , getting away like that . Let's get away . I'd love to . You know I was talking to Keri tonight , I gave Keri a call ,  and um , Wow . .. At Michael's ? ... Unhunh . .. And she was so miserable , Wow . cause she's studying . .. But she only has two weeks left . ... Wow .  Only two weeks left , and , ... I was just thinking , gosh , and then she has .. off , and , she has vacation , and , .. Oh , it just sounded so good . What's she -- Oh . She must be so excited though . .. Well she sounded really .. bummed . .. Actually , just cause school is so tough right now ? Unhunh .  But yeah , only two more weeks . That's a fast medical school year . Unhunh . .. Wow , when did they start . It was really quick . I think , um , .. like midAugust . .. MidAugust . Yeah . Or maybe mi- -- ... maybe the beginning of August . ... ...  Maybe the beginning . Wow . ..  Did she ask you about what you thought of Michael and stuff . .. No she didn't , we didn't talk long at all , she had to go . .. Like she was in the middle of studying ? .. Oh yeah ? .. Like she was serious . ... She's serious . Yeah , she was totally serious . Good girl . Yeah .  Oh honey , I miss you . I miss you too . I miss looking into those eyes , .. Aw , .. and elling those thighs .    oh ,  ... yeah I miss you a lot . It's hard , when Jill's here , we talk about you so much . ... No you don't . Yes we do . You're just saying that . No . We- -- Are you serious ? Unhunh . Wait . .. You really do ?   No . Real ? ..   Really . ... We do . But it makes me miss you more . You know ? .. Just -- Do you guys- -- Do you say any bad things about me ? No . Us ?    Who . Us ?  No ,  that's a wrong clow- .. crowd . Hunh .     ..   ... Aw .   .. Well , ... give me the highlights . .. The highlights ? Yeah . ... Of what we talk about you ? .. Yeah . .. Um , let me think , .. let me think of some good ones . Condense it down to .. a minute . Okay , .. we said something .. so funny today . And I thought when .. Jill said it , .. it captured you so well , and we both laughed , .. cause I think , it was just so funny how well we both know you ? Um , ... I guess we were talking about , ... I don't know what came up , we were talking about TV , or television shows , and I mentioned , yeah , you really , .. you like to watch MASH ? Mhm . And , .. she laughed and said , yeah , .. can't you just picture Jeff , sitting on his couch , .. and watching MASH , with some orange juice , .. with ice cubes ?  ..  And we started laughing , .. and Jill went , .. that's Jeff's slice of heaven . Like little piece of heaven . ..  And we just thought it was so funny ,  because , .. like , .. it really captured you . None ..  Like ,  , we both know you'd be sitting there with orange juice with ice cubes .  Only , ... I haven't had ice cubes here since .. September . ... Are you serious ? Yeah because , you know how big t- thick the freezer gets ? Unhunh ? .. I just don't even bother . I just keep it at a high temperature ? Unhunh ? or  Or , .. I keep it really cool . So , .. it's cold enough for me . .. Oh . .. So you're absolutely right , I drink orange juice , but , .. I go through like a carton of orange juice , .. every two days . .. ... Honey . ... Impressive , hunh .   Aw , the old lady . Oh . She just looked at me , and then , you know what I just realized ? None What None . She looked at me , she was walking down the stairs ? Unhunh . She looked at me , and she d- -- .. she didn't see me . ... Really ? .. Yeah . .. I waved at her and , .. she just .. kept going . .. Maybe .. um , ... if there's a reflection or something . ... What a body she has . ... Isn't that incredible , Are our bodies gonna do that ? It's like , ... it's like , ... she's evolving . ...  You know like , .. it's funny . Or --  degenerating . No . Degener -- Yeah . It's kinda weird .  Hunh . Yeah . The whole cycle of life . What a fucking trip .  I know . Oh but di -- I d- -- I know you would .. you get excited about things like this too , but did you read in the paper , about the ... um planets ? ... cir- .. circulating around other stars ? No , what about them . There's irr- -- ... irreb- -- ... irred , ... ... There's proof .  What's the , what's the word that goes before proof .  Irrefutable . Irrefutable proof .  2 What's the word that goes before proof  .  There , thank you honey , That was so good .   What a good team we are . ..     I could just see myself like lecturing to a bunch of people and , like , oh honey , by the way . .. What's that word that ,     that goes before 2.. honor , None irrefutable None Jeff , I'm like ,  oh yes yes yes , thank you very much . What would I be without her . ..     Um , .. wouldn't that be funny ? None ... Yeah . Aw honey . Wouldn't that be funny ? That would be None . Like if someone was lecturing ? And they said , ... they looked at you  ,  they said , .. is my wife .. here , mwell ,  and , then she raises her hand .    None Oh honey , what wor- .. were we talking about the other night , None What's that word I'm looking for honey . you know , when None ,  ,  You know what I'm talking about .  I -- Wouldn't the whole place just laugh ? .. Yeah . .. I think it's so funny . .. Okay , anyway . Can I run this by you really quick ? Unhunh . ... There's .. this scientist , that came up with irrefutable proof . .. that , there are , ... there- .. they found two planets circulating around ... a sun . ... Or -- a star . ... in the universe ? ... outside of our .. solar system ? ... Really ? And so , ... which like made me think , ... you know like , you know like how we have always talked about life being out there , .. you know , Unhunh . like there has to be . Cause there's planets evolving around ,  um , Unhunh . you know various stars and stuff . Just like ours . Unhunh .  And , but see I never knew that that was just a theory . ... You know , an- a theory that there were planets going around .. other ... stars . You mean you actually thought that we had seen this before ? ... No . No . Actually tha- I I -- .. No I didn't , .. I just -- I just .. thought that it was like pretty much factual . .. Oh , yeah ,  not at all . .. So , you know ? So , it's kind of like a leap of faith , you know that .. we have always .. thought that ? ... M . You know ? I mean like , like the scientist who who does it , can't really prove it . Like they , .. they make this leap . .. of faith , you know , they just assume . ... Right ? that there w- there were planets . .. Mhm .  around other suns . 2.. Right ?  Right . Just .. by the sheer numbers ? They thought , well what are the ... chances . You know , f we have billions and millions of stars . then .. chances are . You know , even if it takes like one in .. a million chance , for there to be another planetary system ? Well , like  we have millions and millions and billions of .. opportunities , to have that .. happen . ... Unhunh .  So , I think that's the whole thing , like Carl Sagan ? .. would always go yeah , billions and billions , like , .. he would say that . .. Unhunh . I think he would say that . But , ... yeah . So anyhow , like w- in what galaxy . Like what .. solar- -- .. Like what -- what galaxy was this star in . Santa Barbara . ...  No .  I'm not sure .  I don't know the .. the details . But  ,  anyway , what it .. made me .. think about was , (YWN) the fact that , you know how you always , this might sound a little silly ? M .  .. But you know how like you , ... like .. I , I , I'm very passionate about ... certain ideas ,  you know ? Really ? Like ,   you know what I mean ?  Yes . How -- And then you're like more scientific , or you're more , .. you know , .. open .. to other possibilities ? Unhunh . .. You know like in , like -- .. you know like you're ch , .. um , .. just- -- even with people . But , with the ide , Like you would- -- Like you would ask , like how do you know for sure . You know ? M . And , ... it's like , ... you know like the -- ... Oh I don't know . Where was I going with this .    That , .. and now , here it is . Here is the factual proof , .. and so .. I can be satisfied . That -- Yeah -- Well , just to show you that , you know like , you can make an assumption . .. And , .. you can assume something that feels , .. you know , .. really .. correct , and and it turns out to be that way . ... Sure , some of the time ? ..  .. Uh yeah . .. I feel like  , .. well if you also felt that , .. .. I don't know , you could feel something that ... wouldn't be proved right . Yeah . .. But , no , but I think that's so .. exciting honey ? No it's okay honey .  I didn't see that in the newspaper .  It's okay sweetie . .. Oh  . .. .. I did -- It was more exciting when I was thinking about it the other night . No , it's so exciting . .. .. I mean , I -- .. I'm s- -- No , my whole idea about , ...    I mean it's so exciting , that I- d- like don't even believe you . Like , I think it's .. that exciting . Oh my God  .  I mean like I feel like it's -- You don't believe me ? No it's so exciting that I feel like , That's . I want to go read it .. in the newspaper for myself . Like I can't believe it . Like how come it's not on the news ,  and , ..   I know . there aren't like parties now . ..   And they even , u they've been studying the two planets ? .. Mhm . And their patterns ? And how they like s ,  Um , .. they , ... they circle the .. the their star ? Unhunh . And , .. they think that there's not , it can't , .. those planets can't sustain life . ... Oh , just from the distance from it ? ... ... ... No . From .. um , .. like , .. from their surface ? .. The .. the planet's surface ? Oh . .. They can see that ? Well , th- t's weird . They get it from , like they pick up heat waves . Oh . You know , and it's , .. it's just , .. obviously they can't se- really see anything . ..  They- -- The only way they could tell that the planets are out there , like they can tell like the stars are , .. are out there are , just .. by radio waves . And , .. and how -- You know what . ... .. God , that's so incredible . and heat waves . I t- i- it's unbelievable , how ..  .. man has , ..  .. you know like , .. .. From this little point ,  in the whole universe . like , .. we've been able to tell so much , just with .. science . ... I know , isn't it wild ?  .. Just with , ... aw , that's so incredible . .. That sends me out there . ... Wow .  ... Totally . Oh . Wow . That's so exciting . .. Oh , honey , you're not pregnant . ... No . I'm s- -- .. Y- you were convinced you were pregnant ?  Well , .. I only got convinced the moment before .. I was waiting for the results . Like .. all before that , well I'm late . .. But I don't feel any of the symptoms . But I got so nervous , right when I was taking the test ? I was kind of not treating it , ... taking it that seriously ? Cause it's just , .. it's such an un- .. NAME? concept ? to think that maybe I would be pregnant ? .. So I wasn't really .. believing it .  .. And then , but the moment that I did the test , I got so scared , and I thought , oh my God , like , this isn't kidding around , like what if I am , and t's a distinct possibility , and I got so scared , like you- -- Did you cry ? .. No , I didn't cry . But Jill was here , like she wa- -- It was so scary , and , ... but , you know , we were watching it , and it didn't turn blue , or , ..  Aw . you know , so , .. it was , ... you know , it was , .. Are you sure it would have been mine ? ..    ..   You know I would've denied it , f you , .. .. if you said it was mine . ...   ..    I was uh , .. messing around with the .... repair man .  .. Honey ? Aw . Honey , I'm just kidding my .. love .    You'd sure learn a lot about me if that happened .  Gosh .  ..   Aw honey , that would just like ruin your whole idea of who I am . Hunh ? .. Aw . It would just like , .. I'd just blow up everything that we had , if I , .. if I was that cruel . ... If you just refuted it . ... If I said no way . T- nunhunh . I'm not taking any responsibility . If it's mine , then .. it's your fault for getting pregnant . .. Oh God . Would -- Oh no .   You think we'd be able to , to make it through that ? If I ,   I don't think s- --   Would you -- .. Would you be able to look above that ?   Would you forgive that .  ... Just let that one thing pass . ..  ... No way .   I wouldn't let you . .. Oh , ... Well ,  I just want you to get pregnant . So you could see how nan , .. I'm gonna take it . S- oh ,  I'll love you and support you , (SNIFF) .. M . send you some money , ..    Great .   Oh ,  sweetness . Oh . What a pain in the ass that would be .  .. I know . you know what , I think m , .. m- -- .. out of anything , it would just be ... that , .. that would bother me . Just like , I don't have the time to deal with it . Like w , .. you know ? Like , what a pain in the neck .   We have to be really safe this summer . Totally . Well I'm gonna go on the pill . ... Oh honey , are you sure . Yeah . Yeah totally , it .. it's -- .. Yeah what are we gonna use , condoms ? .. Right . Well they're coming out with .. condoms for women . .. Right , well , I would never in a million years expect you to wear something like that , honey .  I swear to God . I think those are the grossest contraptions .. ever .  I saw one act- -- Really ? .. Yeah . I just saw one the other day actually . .. They're strange looking . ...   Wow .    .  We had a woman , um , a physician come and .. talk to us , about all the different kinds of .. contraception , and , um , .. to tell us about R U four eightysix ? Is that the .. drug ? Unhunh . Unhunh .  To tell us about that , and norplant , and .. the side effects of everything , and , it was so interesting . ..  (SNIFF) Wow . ..  Yeah , Well is R U um .. forty six , it was really neat . ... is that gonna ... be implemented ? .. Well , it's not , .. it's not available here in the United States , it's only in France , England . and , yeah , and Sweden . .. Right -- But I mean is that , .. are they , .. are there .. people trying to make it law here ? .. I think so , but , .. I just think , .. you know , politically I , .. I doubt .. it will be , Yeah . .. for a while . .. Such a bummer . Yeah . It's such a great , ... you know . .. That would be so great if people could get that . .. Oh yeah . Stay away from those .. prolifers . ..  .. Throwing things at em . .. Oh , .. I know I know . Gosh , ... you know what sweetie ? I think I'm gonna go , like rescue Jill . Because she's been there , and , .. she's probably .. doesn't know anybody , and , .. you know ? Okay , honey .  You- .. you're choosing , you can choose . Oh honey ,  I'm just kidding  .    .. Oh , I'm so glad you guys are having a good time . Nyeah , .. oh it's so great . It's so great . .. Aw , well give -- It's so nice . It- -- Give her a hug for me . Okay . It's almost surreal . having her here ? ... Excuse me . ... BARK ... Hey , how are you guy ? ... Are you Larry ? ... Are you Larry ? ... Yes . How are you . Are you -- .. You're the guy . ... Hunh ? .. You're the guy to talk to then . I'm the guy . Yeah .  I didn't know if I had the right place . .. Yeah , you got it  . .. I just -- ... What are you doing there . You're probably trying t-  -- .. Yeah this is strange , what's this guy doing .  .. I'm putting water in a ... twenty-six gallon container , inside my ... truck . BARK ... Wow . .. That's quite a p- -- Cause I had to haul it to a property , which doesn't have any water , .. and I have to spray the road . .. Ah . ..  ... Cause the road .. before .. you can drive on it , Interesting . it needs ... more uh -- ... more ... stability . ... Evidently . ... So give me one second to lock this thing , and then  , Is that to keep the dust , .. keep the dust down ? ... well , no , .. it's not that so much , it's uh , they put , ... they put a uh , ... a type of uh .. base on it that needs water and , BARK ... that just hasn't happened yet . ... Oh ,  -- I see . ... So there's some chemical reaction that has to take place , Yeah . .. I guess ... a good a- ... analogy . BARK ... Chelsea , no . ... BARK .. That should hold it in there . ... Okay . ... Nice to meet you . How you doing . Good to see you . What's your name ? BARK .. Seth . Seth . Okay . .. Here's my card here . .. Thanks Seth . BARK ... I think it's warming up a bit here . ... Is this the house we're looking at ? ... I'll take you down in the basement . ... Is the furnace down in the basement ? ... What's left of it , yeah . ..  ..  .. We had all these -- Is it a .. old system ? .. Yeah . .. We had the asbestos uh all removed from it and , ... and uh , .. Oh really . ... so that's been done . I was j- -- .. I was just at a place that does asbestos removal . .. Yeah , .. where , Cal -- .. Cal Tech ? .. they're the guys that did it . ... Are they ? ... Alright  . Yeah , .. ) that's down in Berkeley , right ? No they're -- .. they've got an office here in Nappa . ... Cal Tech . What was the -- No . .. Synergy . .. That's who . Synergy . .. Dif- .. different one . I I'm sorry . It's a different outfit . I didn't know they had one up here . Yeah . Though I think they had just recently moved here . Unhunh . ... .. Cause I was wondering t- -- So where's the man with the uh .. camera , and the -- Oh I got the -- .. I got my recorder right here .  ... That's pretty clever . ... Yeah , my brother is uh , ... teaches linguistics , and I guess he's doing this study , Oh , okay , ... and they just want ... business conversations . ... alright . .. Well ? ... Wow . ... Here's the animal . My gosh . ...  Wow . They took ... uh some of it with em obviously . Did this used to be -- .. used to be an old oil nan ... Yeah . .. I think it was an old , nan fire ? ... I think it was an old , ... see the .. oil THUMP nan tank THUMP here ? Isn't that an oil tank ? Yeah . ... That's what my guess is . ... And uh  , THUMP None THUMP Wow . .. do you have a flashlight on you ? Sure do . Yeah . ... So , .. then you get duct work ? .. Or is this the flue . Well , yeah . .. What they did , That's the flue I guess . they they took the stubs , and they cleaned em up . .. So you can tie right into em . See ? ... Yeah . ... So this used to have asbestos . Hunh ? Yeah . Where did all this connect ? Was there a a plenum on top of here ? So , ... Yeah . There was a big hood that went over the top of this thing , with these stack that went this way , Okay . Yeah like an octopus type . and then one that goes back , un- underneath there to the -- .. to the uh .. kitchen , ... there are- there are different -- .. there are different ones , that kinda go all the way up . ... I see one r , there's a rectangular one right there , Yeah . ... is that one right there , w- that I'm flashing my light on ? Yeah , it might be . .. It kinda looks like it . And then there was -- there's one farther up , ... and then there is this THUMP one here THUMP . ... So you have one two three , ... ... at least .. two there , Three , and then there's another one .. way down . .. I don't know if you can see it or not , .. but it's -- ... it's up into the kitchen . ... So there's probably three back there ? and a- -- and any over on this side ? ... Well , ... no but , .. what- what we -- .. we want to p- you to .. kinda give us an idea , on a- w- what your thoughts are . You wanna add a c- -- .. add a few more ? Add a couple . Yeah . ... Back , ee way back there ? .. Is that one way back ? ... Can't see it . ...  .. get this thing , To help -- .. to a point . I don't know what this was , looks like they -- That was connected to one of em . .. Yeah . They left that here . ... I don't see any back in here , but , .. Well there's there's definitely one back there . ... Now there's nothing out here , and this is where we feel we ... we should add one . .. Is , .. this is a , .. gonna be a dining room . ... okay . So , ... uh , one for- -- one .. there .. for sure . What about , .. uh , .. what about above this section of the house . ... Well , ... let me show you that . And you can give -- you can give me some idea about that as well . Now uh , .. you are on propane ? ... out here ? No . .. This is natural gas . Oh really . .. Yeah . .. Oh good . .. Kinda rare . .. That's good , because uh , .. the problem with propane is that , they wouldn't be able to v- -- .. the co- -- .. the county would probably have a problem with it . ... Yeah . Cause they're very concerned about propane . But natural gas , I can put a  -- Yeah . we were real happy to get this place with natural gas . .. Do you want me to remove the old furnace .  ... We'll not .. have to ? .. No uh , .. do you want me to remove it . Oh yes . Okay . .. Yeah . ..  No that's -- that would be part of our deal . .. Yeah . ... Well y- the new furnace w- .. would be much aller . ... That much I can guarantee you . ... Alright . Do you- --  -- .. How many square feet is the house . ... Uh , well I guess it's around twentyeight . ... Approximately . .. Okay . ... I have a roof guy coming about this time too , so , ... You're doing the roof ? doorbell rings , .. we know who it is . ... Getting a new roof put on too ? Well I .. got some problems with ... leakage in certain areas , and just gotta get it fixed , before we get the rain again . ... Alright , well let's start in the kitchen . ... Okay this is -- ... this is one right here . ... See , I don't think you saw this one , but , ... I'm wondering if , .. you don't have a floor plan of the house , do you by any chance ? .. No . ... We don't .   ... We didn't get anything when we bought this baby  . ... I'm wondering if I should just sketch it out . ... Uh , It's two-story though , right ? .. Twostory , .. Th- -- Are there any registers on the second floor ? Unhunh . ... Okay . So all those s -- .. all those stubs that were ... behind us , are the ones that go up through the wall . Oh . .. Okay . ... Well that's no problem , Uh , as long as I don't have to do any ducting to the second floor . yeah . .. No . .. They only -- the only thing that we wanted you to do is tie into the existing ones , .. Okay . .. which are on the ground level , ... How about that one right there . Is that one ? ... Uh , yeah . .. That's one as well . ... And then the return is .. back here . ... Okay . .. Good sized return . .. Yeah . Now you're not looking at .. adding air conditioning . .. Right ? Well , ... we would like to have that as an option .  .. Okay . We could always add that later . Right ? ... Yeah . One of the things you can do , if .. if you don't wanna do it now , ... you can , .. what they call , .. prep for air conditioning . You can put in the coil . ... See you've got the furnace and the coil , Yeah . and then , ... when you add air conditioning in the future , ... all you gotta do is put the outdoor condensing unit , ... and refrigerant piping to that coil . ... So it .. saves -- .. it saves additional work in the future . ... Mhm . Otherwise you gotta come back and put the coil in , which means you gotta modify the duct work , to get that coil in there so , Right . .. if you're thinking about doing it in the future , you might wanna at least put the coil in . It only .. costs about three-hundred fifty dollars for the coil . Oh . .. Alright . .. It's the it's the outdoor air conditioning that -- Well , .. write that in there , anyway in the .. in the quote . ... And now that's the .. the dining room you wanna add ? Yeah . If you -- if you go over and have a look at the dining room , You got a lotta glass in that room it looks like . yeah , .. and we're gonna be making changes to the ... to the house too , so we're .. keeping that in mind . But if you notice , there are no registers in here . ... So , .. Is this accessible ? ... oh yeah . I wonder -- I wonder if , .. was this added on you think , (SNIFF) .. maybe ? ... I'm just wondering if that foundation wall nan M- -- ... It might've been . nan goes to that , .. I wonder if I can get .. into this . Oh you can get into it . Yeah . .. Okay . Oh yeah . I've been under here . .. Oh okay . .. Good . So , this is not a problem . .. Shoot I'd probably go with two registers in this room .  -- .. Alright .  -- I'd probably go like one here Oh yeah , and one .. one there . you'd do one over there as well ? ... Cause it's a good-sized room with a lot of glass . ... Okay . .. Or you could do it , ... you know , you could put like one on this wall , and one on that wall . .. Okay , on the two .. two out -- And then I'd probably tie em both together , Yeah . ... into one Ybranch , .. you know like the room , ... Mhm . ... the room is shaped somewhat like this . ... I could put like one there , ... one there , Now what we'd want you to do , in this case , is maybe -- .. tie those together like that . .. See this this -- The end of this room might be modified . ... So , ... all we wanna know is , ... is that we can eventually be able to do this . ... Alright . ... To to get .. get this ... duct work done , when we do -- when we do the modification to the -- Oh , so you may not do the duct work at this point ? Not .. not in this room .  ..  .. do it in the future . We m- -- .. Yeah . .. Uh I I hate to see us do it , Where are gonna be your -- although if we do it in the sidewalls , Well what would None the modification be . ... Oh we might take this out , .. and we might push this out further , and , .. uh , .. well , here's the drawings , right here . ... Oh ... let's see , .. that's the guest house . ... Where is that sucker None . ... Dining room ? ... Yeah . .. Yeah , I -- It's right -- i- -- .. here it i- here it i- here it is right here , Is this the wall , you can see that -- this is the current wall , oh okay , so are you gonna go out like 2.. three feet or so , So we might -- 2.. we might -- .. we might nan .. do a little modification . a tape- 3.. tapered uh 3.. corners . 3.. A tapered corner there . So we might do .. a little .. of that . .. Okay . But , .. if you're gonna ... put it in h- .. this end wall , then , .. maybe it wouldn't be affected . ... That one might down there . .. Because , we might uh , ... Yeah ,  see well , .. See eventually we have s- -- you know you're right . .. Cause I -- .. cause we're looking at right there , ... course , .. now you gonna go out -- .. That's right . See we're opening this , That's gonna go that way . that -- .. it's -- .. that that that's going out to this master , .. which is gonna go up on the hill . ... Aw , so you'll need -- .. What about .. heating for that . .. Well , .. what we're gonna do is put uh .. radiated heat . .. Okay . In- in there . .. That'll be a slab floor then . For sure . Yeah , yeah . .. Uh , So that one might change , ... Yeah . uh , .. I- that's a that's a good point . I've .. I I'm not .. uh , ... we were th- -- ... The only thing is , .. I don't know how long , is that gonna be like ... in the future , like a year down the road ? ... Yeah . .. Probably . Cause it would be nice to have heat in here in the meantime . ... I mean say you do the furnace , ... It would be nice to have it .. for this winter . Well let me work that out with my wife . ... Put that as a -- .. But one thing you can do , even if you do a modification , you can move the register . ... I mean say we put the register right ... here , .. and that's gonna b- -- nan that would obviously have to be moved , ... you know , it's not a big deal to move it from here to here . Yeah . You might have to add a piece of duct work , but it's not gonna be a major change , Okay . ... Okay . ... And this one you may not have to move at all . That may be okay . ... Alright . ... But then that's probably how I'd do it , some- .. something like that , or , if I had the registers .. going that way , ... that might be the best way to do it . ... It'd be like for- fourteen by six , ... I mean that would probably be an eight-inch duct , that'd be an eightinch , that'd be a teninch , ... and then the furnace , I don't know , it's somewhere over there in that area , Furnace .. is -- I'm not sure how many feet , Well the furnace sits down , .. over in this , ... this corner over here . ... That's where the furnace is . ... One . ... Two . .. Probably right ... in here . Three . ... And now -- That's probably what- -- that's one of the nan That's about thirty -- nan key my key concerns , about thirty-six feet across . is th- .. is the how noisy the furnace is . ... That's a real concern to me . ... And uh , I don't know what they've got these days , .. if they're all -- .. nan I know there's pulse type furnaces , which evidently are kinda loud or something , Oh yeah . ... Yeah . Lennox pulse .  oh really ?  That's a loud one . Is it ? Yeah , Really . I've put a few of those in , and they , Have you . .. I've had problems . I wouldn't go with the Lennox pulse . Okay . ... If I go with a uh , Well , I'd probably go with the Carrier . ... Carrier furnace . The return grill's plenty big enough . .. yeah . It's a big return , I mean I can't -- you can't have any kind of problem there , and a -- and and the pipes are big enough , so , and that's normally when you get -- .. you get .. a lot of noise .. in the house . Is if your -- ... if your uh ... ducts are too all . Right ? Right . .. Yeah , y- the two main sources of noise , .. are either , ... uh , ... air noise , .. which is due to undersized grills , Really ? you got air rushing through there at high velocity . The other source of noise is th- .. is the fan motor itself . In the- in the actual -- .. In the .. unit itself . Unhunh . And that's usually solved by b , just having flexible duct between the unit .. and the d- and the registers , so that it dampens out the noise . In other words if we had the furnace like right behind that wall , it would be noisy . .. Yeah . But we're going d- -- I'm not sure how it .. connects , ... did we see that down there ? ... I'll have to go down and take a look at that again but , Okay .  I imagine it goes down , .. and then we can run some kind of a flexible duct to the unit . As long as I can get say ten feet or so between that and the unit , .. then I -- You can . .. then I can uh ... eliminate th- .. the noise problem . .. Alright . ... So it's basically thirty by thirty , ... return air . ... Thirty by thirty return air . ... And this is a uh , this is the only return , and I'd -- I would say not None None Oh this is return also ? .. not placed , .. not placed very well , in the room . ... This is -- So , this is supply though . Right ? ... this is the supply . Right . Okay . ... Yeah . .. See , and I'd -- .. Where would you suggest .. they would go . If uh , .. if we put uh , ... Boy . .. I would say g , I'd probably go with two . ... I'd put one on each side , I'd probably put one like right underneath that window there , ... and maybe underneath that window . ... Be nice to put it behind the couch , but then you've -- it would be blocked off too much . ... And you thi- -- you so you .. you p- you try and put em under windows , where .. that's where your --  .. Yeah . I try to put em on .. the cold- --  -- basically the coldest part of the room . Okay . ... Because uh , ... it just helps , y .. because otherwise , you know , with a grill right here , .. you end up having cold spots on the sides . Mhm . Cause what happens is , the air goes back to the return grill , so it never really , It wouldn't get out circulating through -- it never really blows out .. to the corners . Right . So that's why I try to put it .. as far away on the perimeter , and have it pull across the room . ... Okay . well this is the only -- So I don't know if you'd wanna -- .. (%) the only the only other addition room , where we thought maybe registers would be important . ... And I'd , .. I don't know if , ... uh , ... floor registers ? Are there -- are- th- i- i- i- is- d- does it -- .. that's not a good idea these days ? ... No , I would go with floor registers in this house , cause you got high ceilings . ..  Well in fact , you wouldn't be able to put any kind of ceiling register in . ... Cause you get the second floor . Right . ... So , no . Floor registers are fine , for heating . ... But th- -- you're talking about wall regis- -- .. putting em in the wall here . ... No , I was- I was thinking about putting em in the floor . Oh in the floor ? .. Yeah to- -- ... to go in the wall , would be .. pretty tough . Okay . ... Alright . I don't know if you wanna cut the floor though . ... Yeah . .. Well I hate to do it right there . May- maybe we'd do it right in here . ... Yeah . ... But to get in the wall would be almost --  ... I mean you can do that during new construction , but it's tough .. when you're coming back after the fact , cause you just got , Sure . your- your two-by-four framing , ... and it's just too tough to get in there . ... Okay . ... Alright . So we'd put a couple in this room somewhere ? ... And then uh , So this is like a family room ? Is that what this is ? .. Uh , it's kinda like a lo- -- kinda a little ... parlor , library , something , ... resembles -- ... Alright . ...  , ...  . ... This is a register , so that's okay . ... Cause it's .. under there , .. Okay . .. the bathroom has a register , ... now that was it . ..  How about the uh thermostat . ... This guy ? ... Okay . .. I would definitely go with a new thermostat . ... Yeah . ... Kind of a ..  antique , But that's probably a good -- .. that's probably a good spot . isn't it . Yeah , that should be in a museum . ...  ... Uh , .. I don't know . .. I- i- are we doing the right -- If I'm supposed to kinda walk you around the house here ? Is that what uh -- ... Yeah . Do you think , .. well , .. I guess you haven't really -- I don't know if there's anything you need to do up here . Other than the fact just kinda know that we've got em . .. Yeah , you haven't .. r- really lived in the house .. during the winter . Have you ? No . ..   And that's what we th- -- So you don't really know , if there's a -- See and that's what we thought we would do , uh , So you're not really sure if there's any problems , ... with heating certain areas , .. That's right . ... so I sa- -- So we don't know if there's any particular areas , like that b- -- I bet you that parlor room has had a hard time , ... in the past .  Do you think it's pretty cool in there  ? Just .. that one grill . And then this guy has a ... register , so , Oh they got AC up here too . ... yeah . .. I n- I think that's gonna go . ... Well uh , .. especially if you get the forced air  heating and cooling , Well , Yes . you won't need that . .. One little guy there . .. Yeah see these aren't ... strategically placed either , but you've .. pretty much got no choice . .. ... On most of these , these -- it's almost impossible to ... to change these now , ... but really on the second floor , ... This one's not too bad .  the heat .. the heat's gonna rise , .. from the first floor anyway . Yeah up to- -- You know . So I nan And it'll hold it in here real well . Yeah . .. Typically , and- if anything you have verheating problems . .. Mm . Yeah . On the second floor .  Well see that's what we wanted to do , is have some kind of a system , that we know we can shut off . ... Certain .. certain areas . Like if w- -- .. One of the things we could do , I don't think they have any dampers here . Do they ? .. ... Oh they do . ... Yeah . ... So you can close off -- Oh okay . .. So that's how it's -- ... Yeah you can close off 2.. individual d- -- Close these off , ...  and then the- -- .. then it'll force the air what . .. Down into -- ... Downstairs . Now ,  the one thing you don't wanna do though , is close off .. too many of em . ... Cause then you put a strain on the -- Cause .. cause then you're uh -- .. yeah , you've gotta have a certain amount of air , for the furnace to work properly . ... And if you reduce the airflow too much , .. then it won't have enough air going across .. the heat exchanger , and it'll -- .. it'll overheat the heat exchanger . Oh . .. Really ? .. Okay . ... So I would say , you don't want to close more than uh , ... more than about twenty-five percent of em . ... Or you can close em , y you know , if you close em uh a a hundred percent . If you close em all the way , ... you probably don't want to shut more than twenty-five percent of em . All the way . ...  ... Which would b- -- .. I'm not sure , maybe all upstairs , ... you might wanna leave em cracked open just a little bit though . Unhunh ? Just to make sure you get enough air , Yeah . ... But , okay , so we'd be looking at adding two , ... two registers for that .. parlor room ? ... Adding two to that parlor room , And then what about that one . Do you wanna hold off on that ? Well , maybe we should just -- ... Or would you wanna do at least one of em ? ... nan I think we should do something , yeah . Only because -- .. Because if that .. remodel's a year away then , I I th- -- I guess I th- -- I think this thing is gonna be a cold little -- .. oh , I can definitely see that  . I I I can tell you that , because the windows , .. See you only like nan .. the only heat you have in this room , is that .. one register over there . .. the windows in this thing are THUMP nan just about ready to fall out . nan I mean they're THUMP -- .. they're not -- .. Look at this . ... So I know there's gonna be a lot of uh -- ... A lotta infiltration . Yeah . Until we get this corrected . ... See hopefully you'll go with double-pane glass on your remodel . ...  That'll help cut down a lot . Yeah . On your nan Yeah . nan heat loss . ... So , .. I mean , .. nan in some ways , having windows , .. is it a bad idea ? Because you get a lot of natural .. heat from the the s- from sun . .. That's right . You know . .. Okay this is like it would get -- So , This is like east facing . Right ? Yeah . The s- in in -- So you get some morning sun . You get the morning , in the winter , it's gonna come right across like this . Yeah . So ,  So that's gonna be good . So that'll be good . So maybe one register in here for the moment , .. until we kinda feel it out would be uh , (SNIFF) .. Sure . .. I mean this one it looks like , .. if we put a register over here , .. you wouldn't have to change it anyway . ... Yeah . .. No that .. that -- With your remodel , that might .. work into it . .. Yeah . .. And like I say , even i- -- even if you do have to move it , .. it's not  a big deal . ... I mean somebody ... just moves it , Okay . .. you know , a carpenter can do it even . You don't even need to have us come out and do it really . ... You might have to add a- -- .. buy a piece of flexible duct and stick it on there , but it's not a -- Yeah . ... not a big deal . .. Okay . ... Alright . ... Okay ? Well that sounds good . Well let me check .. downstairs again , I gotta take some measurements on that room . Okay . .. Well now you get -- you've got the logistics of every- -- Oh wait . .. And then I think my wife , Now you -- .. now you say about -- .. my wife said she would like .. to have a register put in this room . ... And I think it's kinda weird , but , ... what do you think . ... Why would she -- What is this -- what is this room used for .   Well , eventually this is gonna be , ... uh , ... ... and we're gonna open this up . We're gonna take out some of these shelves , and get some light to come through here . ... This is sort of like a pantry ? But , kinda pantry area . .. But it's gonna be an extension of the kitchen . ... Kind of . So , ... I don't know if -- I'd -- .. Yeah , I'd put -- I'd probably put one like right there . ... About right there . (SNIFF) You gonna be putting anything there ? I think -- ... Probably something's gonna go there . Right ? A table or something ? ... I don't know . ... I , Yeah . Cause that's about the only spot .. you can put it . Well , I mean y- we could put a- -- we could put a floor r- .. floor register right .. along here , I don't know if you'd want that . ... But that's probably where I'd put it . .. In fact the one that I was gonna put in there , I'd probably -- We might have trouble getting to this spot though . I think . You think so ? .. Yeah . .. Cause it starts getting real tight up there on this end . ... Yeah . ... Well , .. let's uh , ... Maybe on this end ? ... Yeah . .. It would have to be , ... if anywhere , .. it'd have to be down ,  that's not a bad spot . ... okay . .. It's gonna help out , cause I -- .. See this whole area , you've just got that one grill . ... It's a pretty good-sized area right here . ... Okay . What about the kitchen . Well let's -- .. let's consider that -- Kitchen's got one ? ... kitchen's got one right here , ... Yeah , okay . ... and uh , ... I'm not too worried about the kitchen . I don't like hot kitchens anyway . ... Cause I mean y- -- you got a stove going , and -- ... Ah we're in good shape that way . ah . .. Wait a minute . .. Did I forget something else , too . ... Ah yeah . We're gonna have to put a register out here . ... Because y , this .. this wall is eventually gonna come out . ... And so uh , .. Utility room . ... utility room , but it's gonna eventually be part of the kitchen . ... And we're moving the utility room . ... So , ... and this . T- -- ... This is a joke . .. Nlook at this . ... ... .. Well some of these ,  Maybe maybe this doesn't make any sense , to -- well some of these things you may wanna wait until you do the remodel . ... Like -- I'm th- I'm I'm wa- I'm beginning to wonder if -- Because what I would prob- -- .. What you can do , ... uh , (HICCUP) , is tap right off the plenum . Cause the furnace is ... somewhere in that general area . ... It's right there , yeah . ... And you can just tap right off the plenum with a duct , ... and bring it to this room . Okay . Well that's what we wanted to -- So that can be done , that's what we wanna kn- .. wanna know . that can be done at a later time . .. Alright .  But maybe t- -- That can be done at .. at any time . maybe for the sake of your quotation , Really . you should ... say , this is what it's gonna cost you to put in ... a duct here , ... all these ducts , ... at this time . Yeah . Okay . Now I don't know if -- if we can price em out individually , or not . .. Sure . I call this what , utility r- .. utility room , Yeah . .. Just pu- uh .. call it a -- figure a duct somewhere on this wall you think ? ... Yeah . Let's just assume it'd be on this wall . ... Okay . ... Utility room kitchen , ... that back one we'll call that ... pantry , ... Yeah . .. Pantry , ... and then you got the dining room glass , ... dining room , glass dining room , and then the parlor . ... and then the .. parlor , ... one on each end there . (SNIFF) ... Yeah . .. Cause we can do em now , or we can do em later . ... But it's not ... any more difficult ... to do em .. at a later time . ... So it's not like you have to do it now . Okay . ... So the registers that we're connecting to , that are existing , how many of those we have got . We've got the one in the kitchen , ... and then we've got uh , one in the d- .. living room here , ... That guy , ... then there's one in the bathroom , there's one in the s ... study , ... and there is one in the .. library . .. Or in the parlor . ... I don't know what we'd do with that . ... Do we disconnect that , if we put two , ... or do you leave it . .. Uh , .. yeah I might disconnect that . ... Well it's not .. it's not connected up right now . So , ... Oh that's right . ... so it'd just be a matter w- -- .. Actually it sh- -- .. it should be capped off probably though . ... And this is the study , ... one right there , ... and the bathroom's got one ? .. Bathroom's got one , over by the shower there . ... On the floor , ... Okay . ... Okay , let me take a look downstairs again , ... okay . ... at that furnace . ... ... This morning we're gonna be looking in the book of Exodus , ... And we've been talking about uh , ... Vision . ... And hearing from God . ... I was trying to come up with a definition , in fact I , I looked it up in the encyclopedia for vision . And , ... there is definitely a definition , .. several , ... uh , and I didn't really like any of them , ... uh , .. .. so I thought I'd try to come up with one of my own . ... ... Jim Larson was uh sharing a quote , ... from Yogi Bara , last night , and I wanted to share that this morning . He says you gotta be careful when you don't know where you're going , .. because you might not get there . ... Which says so much , that we need to know where we're going . .. And vision , really has to do with , having an idea of where you're going . ... Our mission is a goal or task which one is destined to accomplish . ... Our vision , ... and here's the -- here's the definition I came up with , ... you can write this down , but uh , .. uh don't use it unless you , ... uh , .. agree with it . ..    It's mentally seeing ,    where one hopes to be , .. in a specific period of time . .. It's in your imagination , in your ... hopes , ... that you're looking ahead . ... And h- ... trying to see where you will be , .. in a specific period- period of time . .. So our vision for the next few years . Our vision for , uh , ... the ... next ten years . Whatever . Uh , what is our vision . ... As a church planter , Pastor Queen came ... ... having grown up here , and having gone off to- .. to school , ... to seminary , .. God brought him back , to start a church . ... And he began to seek God's .. uh vision , .. for .. the church . And through his own personal experience , and through ... the Scripture , ... and God gave him a vision , ... for a church that was committed to being a part of what God was doing , ... a church that was , ... invested in building the Kingdom of God . ... By caring for people where their needs were , ... and by sharing the truth , ... of the Gospel of Jesus Christ . ... .. Our vision is , .. is a direction of involvement toward a final destination . ... When I started thinking about missions , I .. thought immediately of ... the Blues Brothers . ... You know , and Dan Ackroyd , ... comes out , I forget what his character was , but he says , .. we're on a mission from God . ... And that's what the church is about , we're on a mission from God . ... In fact , let me clarify it a little more . ... The church has been given a mission , ... but our mission is not for us to go and decide what we're gonna do , ... our mission is to participate in , an to carry out ... God's mission . .. Because you see God , ... is on a mission . ... God's mission is to build His Kingdom . To build the Kingdom of God . ... To bring the world of lost people into a real and personal love relationship , ... with him . ... Through faith , in His Son , Jesus Christ . ... You know what , if our vision , ... does not include reaching lost people , and caring for lost people , then it's not God's vision . Because the Bible is very clear , that God cares about lost people . Yes . ... God loves .. people who don't have it all together . Yes . ... God loves people who are hurting . Yes . ... God loves people who are suffering . Who are seeking . ... And if our vision , as Uptown Baptist Church , doesn't include . .. In fact , if our vision as individual .. Christians , with a relationship with Christ , does not include , ... reaching out , and touching , ... the lives of lost hurting .. dying people , it's not a vision from God . ... Because God's plan , .. is , .. and has always been , to use .. his people , .. to carry out His mission . ... And we're gonna see that , as we look at Moses . ... Beginning in the first chapter of Moses . I'm not gonna read -- ... I am gonna read some of it , but I'm not gonna read all the way through , ... because we're gonna try to , .. breeze through the first four chapters . ... Let's look how God was involved in Moses . ... Or how God involved Moses in His mission . ... Gary one of the things I want us to do , ... uh , on building beautiful day , is build a taller ... podium . ... ((LAUGHTER) Write that on one of those sheets of paper back there . ... We- -- we need it about right here . .. ... Oops . ... Okay . ... First thing we're gonna see , .. is that God prepares His servants for mission . ... God .. prepares .. his servants .. for mission . ... As we read in -- ... actually as we get to the second chapter , we'll see that , ... Uh , Moses was not only preserved , .. but he was prepared . ... Uh for his part in .. God's mission . .. We have to go to chapter one to get a little background . ... Read with me in verse six of chapter one . ... Now Joseph and all his brothers , .. and all that generation died . .. But the Israelites were fruitful , and multiplied greatly , and became exceedingly numerous . so that the land was filled with them . .. Then a new king , ... who did not know about Joseph , came to power in Egypt . ... Look , .. he said to his people . .. the Israelites have become .. much too numerous .. for us . ... Come , we must deal shrewdly with them , for- -- .. or they will become even more numerous , and if war breaks out , .. will join our enemies . ... fight against us , and leave the country . ... So they put the slave masters over them . to oppress them and f- -- .. with forced .. labor . And they built ... Python , ... and Ramses . ... As store cities . ... For Pharaoh . ... But the more they were oppressed , the more they multiplied and spread . .. So the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites . And worked them ruthlessly . ... They made their lives bitter , with hard labor in brick and mortar . And with all kinds of work in the fields . .. In all their hard labor , the Egyptians used them , .. ruthlessly . ... The king , or the Pharaoh , ... was a little upset . Because , ... the Israelites , who were their slaves . .. who were their servants . ... As they took a census , .. they realized , that the Israelites' ... numbers , ... were catching up . ... With their own . .. Of the Egyptians . .. And this was upsetting , because he saw this as a .. national threat . ... ... From his perspective , they w- -- .. they r- -- .. you know , he just knew that they were gonna grow to a number , and they were gonna outnumber the Egyptians , and then they were just gonna take over . .. You know , if any other countries decided to attack , Uh , and , ... to .. to battle , .. uh , .. the Egyptians , that he just knew that the Israelites were gonna join them , and were gonna .. overthrow from the inside . ... So the next part of the chapter , he begins to , you know , first of all he b- -- he .. works the men very hard . He said man if I work these guys hard , there not gonna be going home to their wives , and there not gonna be , uh , ... having babies . ..  You know , I guess that was part of his plan . That's his first strategy .  so let's make it hard for them . Let's really work , work em ,  so that they're too tired to go home , and , .. and uh ,  procreate . ((LAUGHTER) We'll use that word . But that didn't work . Cause they st- -- They continued to -- ((LAUGHTER) .. They Continued --   They continued to d- -- to uh , .. have babies . And they continued to multiply .  ... So he g- devises another plan . .. He goes to the midwives . ... You know the Israelites had midwives . They didn't have doctors , but they had , uh , women , ... who when a , when ... one of the Israelite women were gonna have a baby , then these midwives just come in , and help .. in the labor process . ... ... Or in the birthing process . ... And so he goes to the midwives and says , .. listen . Here's what I want you to do . ... you go , and you go ahead , and you do your part , .. and you help these .. these mothers , but if they have a boy , ... I want you to make sure that , .. that boy dies . ... If it's a girl , you go ahead and let it live . ... And that was his plan . ... Well the midwives , ... you know , what could they say , this is the .. the Pharaoh , .. so they agreed to it , but then they didn't do it . ... Because they feared God , more than they did Pharaoh . And when uh he calls em , he says what's going on . They're still multiplying .  There's still boys being born here .   ... what is going on . ... The midwives said , .. well these , .. these mothers , ... they're having the babies without us . .. You know , they're not telling us . And they're just going ahead and having em . They're s- -- .. sturdy women . ... ((LAUGHTER) It says , .. they don't need us . .. And so Pharaoh comes up with another plan . It ends up in the ... final verse of this chapter . .. ... Verse twentytwo . Then Pharaoh gave this order , to all his people . Every boy that is born , must be -- ... you must throw into the Nile . .. But let every girl live . ... So he's ordering his people to go . .. And every boy that is born to the Israelites , ... to .. to kill em . Throw em in the river . ... Well Moses was born about this time . ... And this is how God preserved ... Moses . ... Now Moses's mother ... loved her child . ... And she didn't want to throw him in . I don't think any of the mothers did . ... And she wasn't gonna do it herself , .. and she was one of these that had the baby , without telling anybody , except her immediate family . ... And Moses already , ... when he was born , .. had an older sister and an older brother . ... And the mother , .. now when I was growing up , and I heard this story , I just assumed that the mother , was hiding the baby in the reeds . And that's where she was hiding him . But it says for three months , she hid the baby , didn't say anything about the nan .. the -- in the river , or in the , in the uh .. basket . Uh , but then when he was three months old , .. she j- -- she .. was assuming that she was gonna get caught pretty soon , .. and so she devised a plan . .. And it doesn't say here that she devised a plan , .. but , believe me , ... This mother knew what she was doing . ... She b- .. she m- .. got a basket . ... She .. perhaps made the basket . ... Probably did . and then she put , ... what they call pitch , or tar , .. uh , on it , so that it .. would float . ... So that water wouldn't come up through it . And she put .. a blanket , .. put the baby in it , ... wrapped the baby in it , and she told -- .. she brought it down to the river . .. Now she didn't just go anywhere in the river , .. She brought it to a specific place . .. Not just because there were reeds there , but because , .. the Pharaoh's daughter bathed .. there . ... And this was a selected place . The mother took the baby , put the baby , put Moses .. in the water . ... And told her sister to keep an eye on it . ... To keep an eye on him so that , nothing bad happened , but also , there was an- another motive , that we'll get to in just a second . ... So the w- -- so Moses was floating along in the water . ... The Pharaoh's daughter came down to -- to take her bath ? ... And she sees the basket . .. And she sends her servant out to get the basket and bring it to her . And she opens it up , there's Moses , and he begins to cry , and .. Pharaoh's daughter felt sorry for Moses . ... And she just decided to keep him . ... It said , she realized said this is an Israelite baby . ... Aw- aw , poor thing .  ... And so she , .. she decides to keep him . .. Well . ... Here's what .. pha- -- uh , Moses's sister did . ... That was her cue . .. She comes out from hiding , and says , .. Oh , ... whatever your name is ,     ((LAUGHTER) says , .. oh , mighty princess . ... Allow me , .. to get a nurse for .. the baby . ... I know of an Israelite nurse , that can take care ... of this baby . ... Guess who . ... Her mother . ... So she goes and gets .. the mother . Now . ... Why do I think this is something that ... the mother knew about . ... Cause it ends up that , .. nan the mother , .. not only , ... had her child , ... to stay alive . ... But she also , ... got to take care of him , ... and got paid for it . .. .. So God not only spared his life , but He provided , .. uh , for -- ... for that whole family . .. But especially for Moses . ... So we see how , ... God preserved , ... Moses . ... We also see how God .. prepared Moses , .. because in the -- ... Moses's life is kinda divided into three .. stages . Each being forty years . The first forty years he was in Egypt . ... The second forty years he was .. a shepherd . .. ... And the third forty years he was leading the people out of Israel . ... And in this first forty years . ... Moses .. got the best training , ... in the world at that time . ... .. His foundational training came from his mother . ... Cause as the nanny , ... and that's what she was at that point , even though she was his mother , she was his nanny , .. ... She .. trained him ... in the foundations , ... uh , trained him , taught him who he was , ... taught him about his Hebrew origin , ... and the customs of the Israel- ... Israelites . ... Taught him the foundational belief ... in .. the TRUE God , ... taught him of God's promise to Abraham , to multiply .. his descendants , .. and make a .. mighty nation , ... of them . ... Probably the first four or five years , ... the bulk of his time was spent with his mother . ... And he , ... I'm sure she told him that , ... that uh , she was his mother , his real mother , ... and and about what had happened , cause we wouldn't know about it , .. uh , .. if .. she didn't . ... But not only did he get this religious training , ... and this foundational .. belief .. in a r- in a real God , ... but he also , was exposed to the best education that Egypt had to offer . .. Exposed to the wisest teachers , and the best culture offered in the world at that time , he learned about the politics and customs ... of the courts , ... of course this would help him later on , .. when he had to come back and , .. and uh , .. and deal with the courts from .. a different perspective , ... but that first forty years was spent .. in being trained . ... And he was trained well . ... And he had great knowledge . ... A lot of knowledge . ... That he was uh , ... that .. God provided for him , through these ... means . ... And then for the next forty years . he was exiled . ... From Egypt . ... Because , in order to -- ... thinking , ... that because he was an Israelite , ... by birth , ... uh , and seeing ... an Israeli being .. abused , ... uh , he stepped in , and he killed the Egyptian that was abusing him , .. thinking that no one else knew except this person that he had saved , .. he buried him , ... and then a few days later , you know , thinking well it's .. it's all cool , .. nobody knows , I'll just .. go on . He tries to help , ... or tries to intervene between two other , ... uh , ... Hebrew , ... that were arguing amongst themself and , .. and , ... he tries to be a peacemaker , and they say , you know , who made you judge , ... w- what about this , you just killed the guy the other day , Uh , and he realized that people knew . ... And he realized if these- -- .. if these men knew , then probably Pharaoh was gonna hear pretty soon , and so he left . He fled . .. He ran . ... He went out into the wilderness . ... After a few days of .. uh walking , he ... comes upon a a scene , where these two young ladies are herding ... their father's sheep , and uh , some , ... uh , .. mean guys , who knows , I don't .. remember who it was , but anyway , they came up and tried to , .. to uh , ... take advantage of the .. two ladies , trying to take care of the sheep , and uh , ... and I I assume they were trying to steal the sheep , or trying to steal the women , .. either way , ... uh , but , .. Moses intervened , and he ran them off . ... And saved their lives . and saved .. their .. livestock . And so they invited him to come with them , to .. to their home , and they told their father what had happened , and he invited Moses to stay with them , Moses ends up marrying . ... uh , .. one of the young ladies . .. As Ken ... shared with us the other day , it was a .. a mixed marriage , because these , .. uh , .. this family was Black . .. ... So for the next .. forty years . ... he becomes a sheep herder , for his fatherinlaw . ... Who was a .. a Midian priest . ... And during that forty years , he he g- gained some other training . .. First of all he became an outdooran . He became used to being out .. in the wilderness . ... And that's gonna be important for him , for his ... final forty years . ... Another thing he's , is , .. the area where he herded the sheep , was a .. a huge ... area . ... And uh he got to know the terrain , He got to know his way around . .. And that was important because he was gonna spend his final forty years , in that same area . and it was important that he knew where there , the w- .. waterholes were and , and where the dangerous .. areas were . .. ... Uh , ... and so God .. prepared him . ... God also has .. prepared us , and is preparing us , ... for h- -- for our part , ... in God's mission . ... God is continually .. building character . And I think , ... this .. middle forty years for Moses , was a , was a time where God really built character . Cause he no longer had everything he wanted , ... uh , at his fingertips , uh , he had to learn some things . He had to learn . .. He had to learn how to depend on God . ... ON this God that he had learned about . ... From his mother . ... And God is interested in building character in us . .. as individuals . ... In fact , God is more concerned about .. our character , than what we do . ... And how we do it . ... And so a lot of what we experience , we get frustrated with , .. but God's ... purpose .. is to build character within us . ... And so when we're trying to decide w- which we should do or not do , .. something that we're tempted to do , we need to remember that , God's more concerned about our character , and we should .. be obedient to Him , because that's how He builds .. our character . ... I believe that God has created , .. and preserved , .. and prepared Uptown Baptist Church . ... To be involved in His mission . ... To be involved in reaching out to the unloved and the hurting . ... To be an influence . ... to the community of Uptown , ... for the Kingdom of God . ... To be a beacon of light , ... for those who are lost , ... and as our sign says on top , .. to proclaim that ... Christ died for our sins . ... God has also created and prepared Uptown Baptist Church , ... to be a model for urban .. church .. missions to the world . ... And that wasn't .. our reasoning , we didn't set out to do the things we do , so that we could be a model , .. or so that we could ... get ... publicity , ... But God has saw- seen fit to use us in that way . And this is not for our pride , ... this is just ... a reality . ... I'm amazed at how ... people from all over the world , have have come , to the city , and they've come to Uptown Baptist Church , because they heard about us somewhere else , in another country . ... or they read a book , .. uh that talked about Uptown Baptist Church . ... God has crea- -- also .. created an prepared you and me , ... to be involved in His plan . ... First of all He's called us each to a love relationship with Him . ... Some of us have accepted that call , ... and some .. are still struggling with it . ... But still , ... He wants to have a love .. relationship , .. with each person that is in this room . ... He's brought us together from many backgrounds , .. many very different backgrounds . .. to be a family . .. A family of followers ... of Christ . ... A family to be involved .. in God's mission . ... Building the Kingdom of God . ... I was talking to Greg on Friday . Greg Gey ... and he was sharing wi- -- somehow we got in a conversation , and he was saying something about , he ... he really needed .. intellectual stimulation , because he tended to be more intellectual , .. and we were talking about why , some people were intellectual and some weren't . ... And God just ... flashed in my mind . And I said Greg . .. You know God , ... created you to be intellectual , so that you could relate to others who are intellectuals . So that you could share with them on their level . Because God didn't create us for our purpose , .. God created .. us for His purpose . And that's something we have to keep , ... in -- .. before us . .. God has created us , made us like we are . Allowed us to experience the things that we have experienced . ... For his purpose . ... And it's for us to seek Him , and to know what His purpose is . ... Papa Joe has been a , .. a very strong influence in this community . ... Not because of his education , ... his educations came from the streets . ... And as he came to ... a relationship with Jesus Christ , he came from a background , .. that w- had survived , from the streets . ... ... He was an alcoholic . ... Now w- how- -- why has God use him . ... He wasn't educated , ... he didn't go through special training , ... it's because , ... God prepared him , ... with the experience of his life , so that he could reach out to other people who are .. going through the same experience . ... So you can't say well I don't have an education . Or I don't -- I can't speak . or I can't do this . You have to know that whatever .. God has given you , Whatever experience that God has brought you through . .. That He wants to use it . ... To reach people , ... for His Kingdom . ... The second thing I want us to know , ... ... from this st- .. story of Moses , is that God reveals His mission ... to His servants . ... The first that God prepares His servants for His mission , ... the second is that God reveals His mission ... to His servants . ... We have to go to Exodus three , ... and see how God gets Moses's attention . ... ... Apricot mustard sauce . ... ... ... Liver and onions , mm None . .. You should get a Philadelphia cheese steak Beth , how about if I pick for you and you pick for me  .      It's easier that way  . ..  What in the world is a Philadelphia s- --  ..

That's just part of the deal . ... But , Otherwise he'll starve . Right ? ... No , otherwise he doesn't get lunch . .. Well I know ,  that's what starving is .

Now you won't be able to touch Jonathan . ... Just don't tell him . ... Because you're drinking lemon and honey ?  ... She's got a sore throat  . No , because I have a cold . ... Oh . ... Well , ... Don't tell him , or don't tell  Carolyn  . Yeah   --  Yeah . .. And ,  Just don't tell him ,  Martha Jean sat there , and  , and told all about how , .. sick Barbara Jean was , when she was tiny , and , .. And ?  That helped a lot , didn't it . Oh , Martha Jean- -- None Yeah . And what .      Well , Carolyn was , I don't get it .  None Cause , I loved the little bit about .. the potty training .  Eight months old and potty trained None , She always says that . oh my gosh ,  She told me the story of how uh , she .. trained all her kids by nine months . ... I -- Well what was it -- None Now it's .. gotten back to eight , hunh ?  Oh Barb was at eight ,  yeah , the boys weren't but . Oh well . .. They only -- They didn't make it till nine , Who -- who was it that s- -- hunh ? You know boys are slow ?    (SNIFF) Yeah I know .  2.. That said that , ... that's not potty training , that's mother training ? Oh yeah . None Doctor Spock . ... Doctor Spock . ... How about .. Captain Kirk . What did he say .   No no Sherry . 2 You're an idiot  .           2 She's trying  .   ... It's Mister Spock , and Cap- -- I know . .. and Doctor Spock . ... Well , ... what was her story about Barb ? That everyone- -- .. That .. was --  (%) She was in the hospital three times . Carolyn was so affected by , or unaffected or whatever . With ... 2.. asthmatic bronchitis . With bron -- ... And so , how did Carolyn react ? ... Well , I  -- For some reason -- she said thanks a lot , you know , because she was so worried about  Jonathan , Oh sh , None like oh , he's gonna go back again inother words , I said but , And then she .. told her that , she didn't outgrow it until she was five or something ? .. She didn't have what ? We're all going -- ... Barb didn't outgrow it , Oh outgrow it . she was five or something ? .. Mm . .. Oh . So Carolyn was really happy , So , .. yeah because C- -- like oh this is great news . So then I said , but look at Barb , she's healthy now , and Carolyn looked at her , and sort of looked away , and I thought , oh boy .     . Rude . .. Way to go .. Carolyn .  Well .. isn't she healthy ? .. Mhm . .. I mean , she None -- S -- I know she has um , More or less . 2..  she has something wrong with her gallbladder , Gallbladder and , heart trouble and , Oh yeah . back problems , She has heart trouble ? ... Her- -- She has an enlarged .. heart . ... Oh lots of people have that . Oh gosh . That's TRUE . Yeah ? That's TRUE . ... she'd bad back , .. and she's always , .. always using nose spray . ..  ... Maybe she's -- Alw- -- Maybe she's addicted . None None a semihypochondriac . 2..  Maybe there's coke in it . I think that that's ... closer to the truth  . Maybe she's a hypochondriac . Sherry ? Yeah . Yeah . ... I think you're right . Oh . Oh .  (COUGH) (COUGH) (SNIFF) I always have -- .. get backaches . Cause she goes to the doctor a lot . But , It seems to me . Oh really ? ... I think I get backaches because , ... I mean some people's bodies are built a ... certain way . Well , bad posture and , ... just don't take care of it . Well yeah , I'm sure that's part of it . You know ? And also , because of the way you sit , No but I mean , some people get backaches more than other people . 3..  and because ,  you're tall , .. and the world is built for women who are about five five , It's -- ... And it's -- And because you're -- ... The body is not ,  .. It's cause of the way my body is . the human body --  No . But Doctor Hensel told me , that everybody gets backaches . Yeah ? Because y- -- .. The human bod- .. backbone , ... Oh . not the body , but the backbone , Right . is not built , Right . ... for .. an animal ... to walk on two feet , Oh I see . it's built for an animal to walk on all fours . Right . Right . .. So if you were -- spent your whole life on your hands and knees , you never get a backache . That's ... basically ,   Actually , that helps when you have a backache . Hm . .. Really ? .. Is to .. get down on your hands and knees , and walk arou- -- and crawl around ? Mm . Oh , not crou- -- .. Not .. all the way down though . .. Hunh ? Hmm . ... It hurt , .. but then your back's .. gets sway back . No but , ... N- but , .. th- None -- No if you -- But if you're moving it won't . .. If you just stand there it will , Oh .  Well , you know um  , you wanna , but when you're moving , you keep it -- you know Kris Nelson ? ... Yeah . ... Well , .. when I , .. I asked , .. when .. I went in with my .. arm , .. you know , .. cause I had tr- so much trouble with my elbow . ... And , .. so , .. while .. she was .. giving me the .. treatment one time , I asked her about backs . You know , Mhm . and she said the l- -- .. The newest theory is the opposite . We -- .. They used to say ,  that you lie flat ,   Oh , I heard this one . with your e- -- With your knees up ? .. Yeah . So that .. it will .. curve this way .  .. So that it curves this way . Yeah . .. She says now we're having em do , .. uh exercises , The opposite ? .. Arching ? where you lie flat on your stomach , Yeah . .. and you lift your shoulders up . Mm .  And then you keep doing it , until you can have your hands .. totally straight , and your hips on the -- I mean your arms totally straight , Oh . .. Yeah . and your hips down , Hm . so that you're curved way up . Right .  So I started doing that , and believe it or not , my backache went away . Really ? Really ? I'll tell Bill . Cause , that , ... But I can't -- One night that he was so sick ,  when he first got sick , and he .. couldn't -- .. He was walking stooped over , his back ... hurt so bad ,  You have to -- You start out real -- Mhm . Legs , Just a little bit . were numb ? You know , .. We put .. four pillows under his knees ,  None and that backache just about went away . (COUGH) (COUGH) ... But you see , that's always worked for me too , but it comes back . ... Hm . Now his didn't though . Well , then that's what you- -- You know , .. different people have different ty- .. kinds . Well and it was probably just from ... being sick . None That ... caused it , and he just needed to relax it . ... I am conc- -- And that helped him relax . .. Carolyn thinks she's got a kidney infection . ... Oh my .. God  .  Carolyn's al- -- nan Carolyn's almost as bad as Barb , at being sick , .. but , ... She just has these little things that come every once in a while and they're always serious . Why does she think she had a kidney infection .  Well she's got .. a pain , at .. at her waist , in the back , on one side only , ... and she's not , ... .. going to the bathroom as often as she should , even though she's drinking gallons of water ,  ... She's gonna get fat , if she does that .  Water bloating . No , she's gonna get bloated .  It's different than fat . That's fat . Yes I know . ... No it isn't the same thing . ... Looks like . ..  Yeah , but you can lose it real fast ,   Oh I know . once it's --  .. So is she gonna go to the doctor , and find out ? Well she went yesterday , and the doctor wasn't there , but the physician's assistant , ... looked at her and thought it was just a muscle spa . .. So they gave her some -- Oh . He -- .. He or she got a ... some pills for muscle spas , but it hasn't helped , as of last night it hadn't . It's at her waist ?  .. Because they told Marleen , In the back , well , our kidneys are up under your ribs . .. Well , the- -- That's weird , Right , I thought they were lower . right , ... you know , .. Yeah that's what we always thought too , I always thought they were down here , .. yeah that's what we thought , .. where -- But the pain can be just about , you know , Oh , yeah I suppose that's TRUE . you know , pain can be just about any place . But , 6.. they tol- -- Marleen had something wrong , They told her they were None -- ...  .. And , they said your kidneys are up , Really ? ... here . Oh . ... That's weird . ... Hm . ... Hm .   .. I think  , They're higher than I thought .  Yeah . Yeah . I know that -- ...  Cause I always thought they were .. just below your waist .  Anyway  , Yeah , I did too . But there are -- She's , Yeah all sorts of junk in there anyhow , .. kinda , which we don't need  . Yeah . ... .. Well she thought she had a bladder infection , when she was at Whidbey . ... Oh did she ? I didn't know that .  Why , did she have the opposite problem ? ..  Well it's not exactly opposite . But , ... well they're kinda related aren't they ? .. ...  But -- It's just moving .. through her system . But they didn't even do a urinalysis . .. Which I think is ridiculous . ... When she went in yesterday . ...  S  But will a urine show .. kidneys ? ... Sure , Will it show a kidney malfunction ? if there's an infection . .. Oh I didn't know it would .  ... I guess it would . Because they did that for Bill , they thought he had a kidney nan Oh they did ? But they never figured out what he had ? .. He had had pneumonia . ... Eventually . The second week he had pneumonia . The first week he -- Really ? ...  He had a vi- -- Apparently just had a virus . I None -- Oh , I thought it -- Or either that or the- -- They didn't know what he had . ... He had pneumonia ? .. Yeah , he eventually .. developed it . Is that the first time he's ever had pneumonia ? ... No . ... He's had it before ?  -- ... When he was .. real little , he almost died of pneumonia . Oh . When he was -- Oh really ? ... Hey . About three . So , now Bill and Jonathan are a natural class , right ? Right . Oh I get it . ... But he outgrew it when he was five too . ... A little older than five . ...  When they quit going to Lewiston every week ,  to see his grandmother  . ..    Oh that's when he outgrew it ?  ... He used to have ... .. asthma attacks , every time they'd go to Lewiston . Oh . ... That's a drag , he must have liked her a lot . Hunh ? ..  Or was it the cl- -- He doesn't remember . .. Oh oh . ... (COUGH) (COUGH) His mom said it was , (COUGH) (COUGH) She said she- -- They went every nan just about every weekend . She hated going . ... His mom ? ... Which f- g- -- .. It was Jack's mother ? .. Mhm . Oh . ... Hmm . ... That's nan But they had to go see her . nan pretty bad . ... But he outgrew it . .. ... But , .. it scared Marleen , cause that .. was one of her dad's problems ? ... One .. of her dad's problems None . What . .. Asthma ? ... Oh . ... ... Seems like we've got every bad thing there could be in .. our family . He had a lot of things though her dad . .. ... I was talking to .. a gal at work , ... Karen .. Baxter ?  ... Karen Berringer Baxter ? .. ... Who's gonna have a baby , ... -- .. She's -- Does she have any already ? ... Hmm . .. Hm . She's my age . ... Yeah , I know , I remember Karen . Her husband the one that had -- I -- 2.. Berringer . I know the gal . No , her sister's husband . Oh okay . ... Um , ... but , .. she said they did a um , ... ... glucose tolerance test on her , Yeah . ... and there isn't any diabetes in their family , and she goes to doctor Hensel . ... And there's diabetes in our family , and he never did one on me , for either of the kids . ... Maybe they picked something up in a blood test somewhere . There must be some- --  Oh -- That could be . Her -- ..   But -- And she had gallbladder problems , ... right before she got pregnant .  N --  Well , .. So , .. it could be that they're --  And then there's -- And there's such a thing as pregnancy ... diabetes . Mhm .  Where you don't have it any other time . And , she may have shown signs of that , Really . and then -- I never heard of that . Mhm . (SNIFF) ... Hm . ...  That's pretty weird . Mhm .  Could be .  She didn't say , anything about that . See I never had that . ... But .. Grandmom did . (SLURP) When she was pregnant with me . Oh she did ? ... Oh . (SLURP) ... Were you big ? ... When you were born . Seven thirteen . Oh , so she didn't have .. one of those classic signs of diabetes . Nope , ... y- f- usually don't on your first baby . See , but I did . But your babies were late , Beth , my babies , none of my babies were late . Yeah but , Laura was still big . Even -- That's what .. Mom's hoping , that it means , .. it doesn't mean anything about having diabetes . Oh . I know .   Laura -- Uh d- Laura is -- I mean Laura was big 3.. .. anyhow . (%) was big , would've been big anyway , even if she had been on time . Cause she was big from the very beginning . .. Yeah . I mean I went in at twelve weeks , and he said , .. this is a big baby or twins . .. Right . Yeah . ... So she was -- .. ... ... Bill said t- last night , he said , ... something about ... the next kid , I says Bill , ... I don't want ... any more kids . ... I'm kidded out  . ... He says , .. he looks at me and he goes , .. Beth , .. nothing ever flaps you . ..  I said y-  , None  None  ... now that's .. not TRUE , he said you could have six kids , and you would just .. be calm and cool , None and just be Beth . You go , None guess what Bill , you're wrong .      But now Sunday just about did it . I wouldn't be Beth --    .. None I wouldn't be Beth anymore .   2..  What happened Sunday . .. Oh , .. I just ... about had it . With Anna and Sharon . And I .. told .. Sharon , .. What they were just --  What were they doing . ... They were -- .. Mostly Sharon .. got on her bandwagon about Missus Jackson , .. and I just about came un- -- About who ? Missus Jackson ? Jean Jackson ? ... Oh I didn't hear 3.. anything about it .  ?  No , you'd left .  Oh , It was later . well tell me about it .  Cause I hadn't heard all of this .  She was saying that , ... .. that , ... that , ... we were talking about , .. um , ... different students being held back for different reasons and that , about , ... children ... being put , oh I was telling .. her about , .. that one of your girls ... read at such a low level that , really should have been , .. and they said well why didn't they put her in .. remedial , .. and I said , well I don't know but , She was in remedial . Well , I said for one thing ,  ... they can't put em in remedial , without the parents' consent . .. And then , the whole thing about , that .. Greg went through in , ... the first part of second grade , his first ,  and she was so upset because , What happened ? .. What happened ? They wanted to test him for a remedial class . Who , 3.. Greg ? Greg . Yeah ?  It isn't a remedial class , They wanted to test him ? it's called resource room . Okay , Yeah . I know . resource room . But , Whatever . just a re -- And she wouldn't let em ? One -- ... Well , she never did anything about it . ... But she was telling Anna , They never tested him , that Missus Jackson , or they did . demanded he go into the resource room . I said Sharon , ... that's not right . I said she .. suggested .. he be tested for it . That's two different things . That was the first thing I said . And then she was saying , .. well she just didn't do Greg any good . You know , .. and I just about , .. I didn't , ... I didn't , b- .. but I , ... you know I told Bill later I said , ... Greg learned more from Missus Jackson , than he ever learned from Missus Meyer . .. Oh well . Probably . Because , he tried harder for her . Mhm ? You know ? .. And he .. really -- Here's our lunch , finally ,  And he , he made a complete sw- -- .. not complete , but he'd im- -- ... Made a big improvement . Mhm , Mm . The Caesar salad with the kebabs , Hm . .. That was mine . ... Okay , he made the kebabs a little bit bigger than I -- ... regular , and I made the salad a little bigger , so we put em on separate plates . Oh wow .  And I'm gonna get full then , hunh . What a deal . I had the croissant . .. Mm . ... Thank you , Thanks . And -- ... Is everything alright now . Looks fine . Looks delicious , Looks good , Okay great . Thank you . ... So , .. and that was , .. Mm , that kind of , ... I mean she was going , Bugged you . and then she said , ... she says well , and if -- She- -- Missus Jackson is still there , when .. Doug gets to second grade , she's not gonna get her hands on him . ... Oh brother . and I said Greg , .. Doug would probably do wonderful ... in her class . .. Greg did w- r- -- ... finally ... did well . Well and , for one thing it bothered me , because Anna takes ahold of something like that and doesn't let go . ..  ... And Sharon doesn't .. even think about what she's saying . She just starts y , ... nya-nya-nya-nya , and I was just , .. You should tell ... Sharon , that principals do not take kindly to parents telling em what room they want their kids in .  ... Mm . I thought boy . ... They oughta put Doug in there just to show her .  ... Mm . ... Sh- probably just as well I'm not having Doug . Well she just -- .. I mean Greg . There's just the whole attitude . That --  ... What , ... what grade is ... Doug in . ... He's starting first next year . .. In kindergarten this year . Hm . .. Hm . ... But , you know , ... like , ... she knows , so much about it . You know ? ... I said probably that one day the -- ... The teacher and you both just had a bad day , and it came off on . ... Yeah . ... Probably just as well I wasn't there . ...  Oh , I was , ... ... I told Bill , I had several things I wanted to say , and I probably would've , if Anna wouldn't've been there . ...  ... ... But I watch myself a lot closer around her . ... ... ... M- ... ... This is good clam chowder , but it's not as good as Uncle Don made . ... He made some ? ... Oh , after they had gone clamming ? One of those --  You know , .. I don't think Sharon would've said it , if you'd've been around . ... She better not . ... Uncle Don made it ?  ... After you w- --  Yeah , but , 2.. they went clamming ? surprisingly enough Sherry , ... it didn't taste real clammy . ... Really ? .. Mhm . Hm . ... Yeah it wasn't all that good . ... Well it was good , but , .. it didn't , Yeah what's the use of having clam chowder , .. it wa- didn't -- if it doesn't taste like clam . Because evidently , fresh clams don't , haven't developed a real strong flavor yet . Hunhunh . ... How do they get their flavor . ... Being canned or something ?  I would think so . ... Oh . ... Hm . ... And refrigerated . ... Mm . ... Just aging . ...  Hm . Um hm . ... ... Oh , I had a s- soupspoon and didn't see it . Till just now .   ... Oh well . .. But , ... You guys all -- All drinking the same thing ? .. Mm . I know Tommy's having the red wine . No . You want some more ? Tom , what do you want . Mhm . .. Yeah I'll have a little more Tuck . Sure . Sure . Course he wants red wine . Red wine ? .. Mhm . Which is right there .  Everybody wants red wine . And Pop , you're drinking champagne ?   No , I'm gonna switch I think and , What do you want . 4.. I don't know what I'm gonna .. end up with here . .. You want me to get something ?

Bring- -- W- -- W- whichever you want me to  -- Yeah . Bring the bottle , Yeah- --  bring the bottles . and another glass for me .  bottle .   None You know I'll have some champagne with Tom . None Okay None .   I --  Anyway ,  , anyway ,  , in my in my checkered career , when I started off as a young fellow in the war , ... first of all , my father was in None -- How old are you now , live -- N None None I I -- Now let me start with the -- None Next week I'm gonna be seventy .   thirtyeight . ... You're gonna be seventy ? Are you really ? Yeah . Are you really ? Jesus Christ , you're older than I am . Congratulations . Thank you . ... Uh , ... and tomorrow Reese is gonna be twenty two .

That's a nice -- last week I was sixty , Yeah ,  .. yeah ? .. Good . ... I ad- -- I look up to somebody who's seventy . I do too . I admire somebody who's seventy . 2.. Yeah I , Well I -- p- to- -- Boy that's -- Well particularly when they're tall . .. You know I have never (%) particularly admired uh President Nixon , Yeah ? They don't -- but the other day he had this great quote . .. He turned eighty . .. And someone came to him and said , .. what do you think about that , and he said , .. I hate POUND being POUND eighty ,  until I thought of the alternative .     And I said ,    I'm really beginning to like old Tricky . Now the alternatives aren't ,  aren't really worth much .  Right ,  yeah ,    yeah   . Yeah . 8.. Yeah .  And he has thought of the alternative . Did you -- Yeah . He should have .  Have you -- Are you -- Have you read .. Halberstam's .. Fifties ? He should have . ... I'm in it right now . God he None -- I've got it home right now . Did you -- Did you read about .. Nixon's plans for his funeral ? That he -- Yes yes . That he created ? Isn't that marvelous ? I did not read that ?  Yeah . ... Uh , well I'll loan it to you when I get through , Oh . but it's gonna take me a long time to get through  . Okay . No I've got it right now .    Alright , I had trouble with World War  --  M- th- -- Hm . With the Korean War , Thomas , that took a long time .  Tucker , you are just , gotta be okay . Thanks . Oh , For a person that's got only a middle name , thank you Tucker . 4.. I've had , had a lotta practice at this sorta thing . And no uh first name or last name , ..   I mean , we just .. gotta love you , That's all there is . right ? 7.. Yeah 7.. yeah , Just Tucker . .. um , Hm  . Nothing else . ... Anyway , when I was a young fellow , .. living in New Jersey , .. in nineteen ... fortyone , .. uh , .. I graduated in high school in nineteen fortyone , I went to work in a steel mill .  .. And uh ,  .. lo and behold , th- the big war came along . Mhm ? ... And I went .. to my father , and in in these days you know , kids  always , ((CHAMPAGNE_POURING) None w- -- As opposed to today , Mhm . you always went to your parents and said , I wanna do this . Oh yeah . M- may I .  I said to my father , ((CHAMPAGNE_POURING) I said , Mhm .  hey look . I wanna go in the army , and be None an army pilot . Mhm . ... He , ((CHAMPAGNE_POURING) 2.. absolutely , 2.. was , .. so incredibly upset I couldn't believe this .   Because --  5.. He -- He was horrified .  Well he had been ,   Yeah ? he had -- he had been in the uh , in the three twe- -- three twelfth infantry , in the seventy-eighth division , Ah . .. up through the Meuse , and the uh , M the Rainbows ,  then the Argon , and the whole trick , and uh , Yeah . he got wounded , and , and , he w- -- You know and he never told me much about this , but I understood , very clearly , that me -- nan He signing my papers , to join the  army air corps , Mhm ? in nineteen .. fortyone , after Pearl Harbor , .. was sort of out of the question . So , Mhm . (SNIFF)  And you were only eighteen .  Or nineteen .  Right ? Well I was probably seventeen maybe . Well you had to be twenty-one  .    So anyway , Oh I see . .. Mm . I found out about this merchant marine acadamy at Kings Point , I see . Mhm . so I went home to him and said , one day , hey I got this great deal Pop . .. .. I -- They will .. take me into this acadamy , it's sort of like West Point and all this bullshit , and , they'll train me , and blah blah blah , and so he signed . Right ? Well , it turned out , ... after the last dog was hung , that , .. that the highest casualties in the war were the merchant service , In the merchant marine . per capita .  Yeah . Right ,  but ,    Yeah . he didn't know that .     2.. So ,  Yeah .  No big deal .    Yeah , So anyway , I sailed -- can't shoot back , (%) I sailed off to the war , you just sail fast . and never looked back . ..  Uh , .. Unhunh .  So you started in the , in the , .. in the .. merchants . In the merchant marine . Hunh ? Merchant seamen . Oh yeah . Oh . And and and and I stayed -- United States Department of Commerce . I st- -- I --  I stayed nan , I stayed in the merchant navy , um , .. my first trip was around the world out to the Middle East , uh , I came back , I went to school for a few months , I was involved in uh , I was second mate in a ship at the uh , in Normandy , We made twelve trips from Southampton to uh the beaches , until we were in a collision , and then they sent us home , patched us up , sent us home , ... and then I came back into Italy , and we went into the invasion of south France , and we went across the uh , the Atlantic and Pacific , Mhm . and the war ended then . And so I stayed in the merchant marines for another year or two , (GULP) and then I went to college at uh , nan University of Pennsylvania , ..  and then --   Where my father went . ... Hm ? Where my father was . Good . .. Good school .  None Went to school None .  Uh , I didn't do terribly well there , even though my uncle was a business manager , and maybe that was part of the problem ,  um , (SNIFF)  I was more interested in , in .. reliving my youth , or living my youth , and , For the first time .  anyway , Right ? .. make a make a long story short , Sort of get a holding of it . M- --  when they posted the grades , .. in fortynine , ... I , I immediately went to New York , and shipped out as second mate on the African Pilgrim ,   and went to uh , .. South Africa  .        2..  On the African Queen . I -- .. With uh , No , the African Pilgrim . Oh . Okay , None Pilgrim -- I thought -- .. I thought you were there with -- The African Queen , actually was a two h- -- wi- y- -- .. Was a two hatched , Katharine Hepburn . y- i- it was a it was a story . But she was a real ship , a two-hatch ship , based in uh , in , .. in uh , uh , in um , ... nan uh , West Africa . So I sailed on her for a little while . .. Um ,  ... and then in fifty , (SNIFF) forty-nine I guess .  ... Uh guy named Near- -- Now let me stop you now , 4.. Yeah .  Yeah . .. Yeah . .. nan since you're of record . Yeah . But , n- it's primarily because I wanna know , when you say you were sailing now , ... what were you doing during these different phases of your sailing life-  . Da- I was sailing second mate . .. You were second mate then . Yeah . I was second mate on the African Pilgrim . 2.. Okay . 2.. Alright . Yeah . .. Yeah . This is my first mate . ... Pf-  Hi first mate .   Uh ,   Hi . can we get you a chair my dear ?    No , I just came out to see if you were st- still going strong None . He's still alive . ..  And you are ? He's st- -- Uh ,  And he's still  . So , He's doing quite well , actually . I'm gonna go back in . Because it's chilly . Alright . 5..  ... You just didn't want to uh , .. think he might've fallen over the .. fence .  Right . Right . Or just go over the fence in the corn . Toppled over it . Right . ... Anyway I was sailing second mate in the Pilgrim , Right . um , ... this was American South African lines , Mhm .  um , and .. and , nan in fortynine , I think it was , I got .. sort of fussy with that , the purser was a guy named Bob Heins , he and I decided that , well we'd sort of wanna do something more adventuresome , so we .. we jumped ship in uh New York , .. paid off . And we took a passage in the America , ... and went to Paris . ... I stayed in Paris for ... seven eight or nine months . Mhm . My friend Bob Heins stayed for twenty years . .. Ah . He .. he sort of got hooked on that . He got -- He he understood what was r- -- Hmm ? What was up and what was down . Right ?     3.. Oh he married over there and ,  went to work and , 3..  He knew what was --  He figured it out . 3.. He knew what the hell  this world is all about .  He figured it out . 3..  . Yeah . 4.. Yeah . 4.. Figured it out .  So uh I had a lot of interesting adventures there . And finally , when I ran out of money , uh , I wrote home to my family and said , would you be kind enough to uh , please send me a passage home .  And they did .  Well ,  Ah . .. I was then .. twenty-five years old , so I , um , well I did what any r- red-blooded American boy would do ,   I took it down to the American -- uh , .. to the uh US Lines and I cashed it . Right ? .. Right ?  So I stayed on that for another month or two . Mm , you stayed for life ?  And then I wrote home and said , gee I'm --  I need another passage home , and then , Somebody stole it .  they sent it- sent it to me , and this time when I went down to American Expre- --     to .. US Lines and they said , well there's a hold on this .  This can be only used for passage home .      3..  I said , oh . Ah , art family . Oh . So anyway , I sailed home in the uh old Isle de France . .. Uh , .. got into New York , there was my mother and father and , and we popped in and it was , things were a little tight , and a little .. tensy ,  went home , Mhm ? my m- .. grandma was there , my mother was there , we sat around the dinner table , and n dinner was served , and finally my mother said , well tell me . What did you do in a typical day in Paris . .. ... Mhm . Made the most brilliant move of my life .  None I said , And you said .  Please pass the butter .       And this subject's never been brought up since . 6..      Right ,    yeah . I like that .  Yeah . I like that .  Anyway . Uh , .. Very good . .. Very good . Yeah ? So that was fortynine , fifty ,  I went to work for Grace Lines in New York , as a port captain , Mhm ? sailed in a couple of Grace liners , south , .. uh , ... Korean War started , I had the uh , I decided well shit . Might as well join the war . Threw in my hat . D- uh , ...  uh , ... when I came back from one of those uh .. trips from down to Cartagena , I found a big stack of navy orders . ... Right ? ... Mhm ? So I went to this , .. m- what I thought was my friend , um , th- this navy captain down at ah naval headquarters . ... I said this is terribly awkward . I've just been promoted from third mate .. to second mate , and and could we nan possibly postpone these orders , for a little bit . ... My friend stood up behind his desk , .. in his full four stripes and said , Lieutenant ? ... You are in the US Navy now None .   I said oh .  . ... No one ever explained that to me before ,  and a week later I was on my way out to Korea .   yeah . Oo . ..  ..  6..  Where you got promoted really rapidly . Right ?    Well , no , I uh v- -- Finally uh , I , you know , after a couple months I got promoted Lieutenant , and you know , and that sort of thing , but uh ,  it was all -- Mhm . I loved the Navy . I really did like the Navy . Mm ? It was just an exciting thing to do . So how many years there . ... I stayed in the US Navy , seventeen years and ten months . ... And then I was forced out , because I failed a promotion .. to commander . ... So , ... but all that service time you put in . .. Thirtyfive , or forty years or something like that . Well , but I'm am p- -- Right ? Mhm . I'm on the retired list for pay , for twenty-three years service . ... Twentythree . Yeah . That's -- That's that's what I was trying to get at . So after all this happened -- Now is that because of World War Two , and the uh -- No it's because of the f- -- the way the Navy worked . And of uh , Mm . so I went to this guy and uh , and and I was a reasonably hotshot officer in the , ... Pentagon at the time and , and I went to him and said , hey , how come this is happening , and he said well , there's , happens to five guys like you . .. Because the way the law was written . ... And we fixed it as of nineteen fiftyfour . Instead of saying you , if you failed a promotion you re , retire as of twenty years from your pay entry base date . ... Mine was fortynine . .. Uh , ... they said , what we've now said is , you have to stay twenty years . So I said fine . So , .. handshakes all around . Mhm .  Then I went off and worked for a couple of companies and , Mhm . uh , ... my .. my success in life , if I can say it is , is is , consists of two things . Skill and luck . ... Mine's primarily luck . Ten perc- -- Ten percent and ninety percent's the right mix .  Mhm . 3..   And uh , so anyway , Yeah ,  I uh struggled along ,  and uh , one damn thing another , uh , ... and then one day Debby said we're moving to Santa Fe , and I said well , Now that was her s- choice , Sounded like a nice idea . hunh ? Oh yeah . Hey man , Hmm . it was a binary decision . Alright , I had no choice , let me ask you a very important question . you know ? And this is one that's crucial .  None Yeah None . Why did you put the extension on your fireplace . ... Oh yeah  .  To keep the make the fireplace work . Extension in the fireplace .    No I didn d- -- I didn't put an extension on the fireplace ? He is- -- He is a uh , No you didn't .   He is a .. aerodynamic uh expert .    7..      8.. No , 8.. On uh 8.. chimneys . the fireplace is the way we found it . .. Oh . Okay . .. Yeah , Well you didn't do that then . But somebody did before that  , No , it's it's a little thing that sticks up above the roof ? .. Yeah 3.. hm ? Tom thinks that mine doesn't work as well as it should , because it should be extended like yours . He thinks it , Yeah . that the , No it should j- -- We we haven't done a thing with it , It needs to be higher , You see because you get a down , no .  None on Tom's , The outside of the house was exactly the way we found it . the uh --  2.. Oh . Okay . Yeah . Alright . Uh ,  Alright , see Thomas , I tried . So whoever ,      was living there before , that's the one who discovered they needed to do that . Alright , now who was the guy there before you . Doctor Green . ... Alright nan , .. is he alive ? .. No , poor old Green .. shuffled off , Oh , uh , oh my God . To Buffalo . Shuffled to Buffalo . I can't talk to him , Thomas . .. Yeah uh in fact , quite a -- Well , No it's -- See I've 2 been trying , you're probably right . 2 I think  , You're probably right . I've been trying to tell him , the reason that , on very still .. nights . When it's cold , and everything else , he'll get a downdraft .  In his fireplace . And it's because the cold air , ... builds up . ... On the top of his roof , and comes down , This is what the judge does on his spare time ? the fireplace . Yeah , Yeah . He's k- -- Yeah . Pushes , He's actually quite an engineer . pushes fireplaces ? I see , Well , my background is in construction work . He's an electrical , and uh , Oh . He's an electrical and carpentry engineer .  I see . Okay . .. Mm . .. Now we didn't change a thing on the outside of the house . He's been --  Hmm . No- -- We've done a few tricks inside . .. Mhm ? He's pretty good at that stuff . We built a garage , but that's all . .. Yeah . Uh , ... our fireplace draws very well by the way . .. Uh , Yeah well , I would , n- I would think it would . Yeah , .. uh , ... see this is what I've been trying to tell him . With that extra s- -- extra height . But , ... but see Thomas , likes the idea that it doesn't match in ,  None with the design . With the area . Well we gotta , we gotta call up Jack Eaker .         Right ? Right  . You remember -- You know Eaker of course . Yeah . 5.. Ah . .. You know what Eaker's doing right now . .. No . We k- -- We have a f- -- We we've b- we belong to this uh , we don't belong , but we attend First Church down here ? ... Uh Presbyterian ?  Unhunh ? Presbyterian ? On the -- Unhunh ? 2.. And they've been after ungh- I guess , for , .. three years now to join , two and a half years to join the church , and I keep dodging the issue by saying I'm out of town and , blah blah blah , but nonetheless , Mhm ? we got a new guy k , named Mason called up and said , hey , would you join , and we had a nice conversation , and he talked about .. Jack Eaker . ... Said wonderful he said , .. we .. talked about n , he said Jack is rehabbing a house , like he did this one . ... Over by the Mansion now . ... Governor's Mansion . Yeah h- yeah- -- I h- I knew that . One point two million he wants to sell it for . Yeah . Mm . ... Mm . I said to Debby ,  Mm . I think we're gonna move up to the Rogue River , Mm .     by uh ,  Hope he does a little better job at , .. some of the things like electrical  .  How'd he do here .   Hunh ? He did too much himself ,        that he should've put in somebody else's hands . Oh yeah . Like he ,  ... we had -- None Oh he did it all himself . Yeah , we had to do a whole bunch of electrical over , None because he hadn't done it quite right , and ... stuff but , Really ? ... Oh you pulled the whole kitchen out . it's 2.. s- -- Hunh . .. Yeah . .. Yeah . .. Mm . Mhm . .. We found , you know , ... wiring that wasn't what it should have been . But that's all right . He was- -- Yeah . He's a he's an enthusiastic amateur . You know , he .. worked --  .. He worked hard at it . Well I am too , Well he's no amateur . Thomas .     This is about the tenth house he's done you know .  Well s -- Yeah ?  .. D- some people are amateurs for a long time . Yeah . Yeah .  Yeah . I know a bunch of em .  ... And they get paid for it . Uh . He put too much electronics in it too , but , Yeah . for me but , And and of course , when he , when he , ... he put in , ... he told us four thousand . I couldn't believe it .  I said Debby I can't believe this but , he had these , goddam , ... pf- uh , ... perennial flowers here , .. or are they annuals .  Which is which . ... Which is that doesn't grow next year . ... Annuals ? ... Uh , right . Oh God . Yeah . Right . The annuals , 3.. He had all these flowers around . yeah . ... He had the most beautiful looking place you ever didn't want to see . Um , ... ... Did he ever tell you why he put this fence between our house ?  ... Unhunh . ... This this uh , .. thing he's put up ? ... When we went on a .. to trip . ... Uh , ... w- he he'd come over , and we had a few drinks , and we agreed , ... along this .. common walk , we were gonna put up fir trees and all this stuff , .. uh , ... and then uh , .. we built the garage . .. Which .. m- meets code and all that . .. And Jack was so upset about that , when we came back from the trip , we found he'd built the fence .  And I said to Debby ,   I didn't even see the fence for three days , she said what about that fence .  I said fence fence ,  Yeah .  you know me . What fence .   And uh , ... so I said gee whiz uh , Hunh . .. uh- s- so we'd found out that Jack was , f thought that that took away from the -- The aesthetic . ... the aesthetics to have this garage , and I said well gee whiz , that's fine . So that's why he threw up the fence . And I said hey look , we're all within the code . I first wanted to build the garage , ... sort of , with five feet from the property line , and he made a big fuss about it , so I looked it up and said , well we'll make it uh .. fifteen , what ever they want , We moved a few fractions and ,  It works fine , don't you think , the way it is ? Hey look , I have no problem at all , Looks  , uh , except Polly can get right through it . No look ,  hey , Polly and I are pals . .. Polly has .. three things .  Mhm . He -- .. He -- ..

She needs to get into some in campus group . Like the writing Tom was talking about . Which would really be great . ... Cause she's good at it . She might a- n -- Might alw- so , be a little .. more helpful to her down there , if she had a- .. a television , so when she goes home then , there's something to do besides sit around .   And be lonely . Yeah .  .. That too . ... .. So , Well , she's gonna , It'll work out . she's gonna do okay . She's really got her head screwed on right . .. Uh , .. we were talking about , I was talking to her at least about her courses and , ... what she's reading , and what she's doing , and she seemed very enthusiastic about it , and uh ,   Yeah she likes all that , uh , very well I think .  and despite the uh , ... uh , the current notion that's going on , she was actually reading Jane Austin . Could you believe that ?  She's reading all kinds of interesting things . Yeah . Yeah . Mhm . Super . ... It seems like . Uh , Well she's been sort of doing that for a long long time though . Mhm . Yeah . Pat has , Yeah .  has always sort of ,  Yeah . uh , .. been a little .. different than the -- I I told Pat that I had this huge library in my house , which I do downstairs , that's , been sealed up now for six months , while we finish this thing , ... all kinds of books that , ... we discussed that she knew some of , and not others , and I said , ... hey you're welcome to come by any time , and snoop through that and , You've been very nice to Pat , in the 2... literary area . learn some things and , uh , ... cause you know , if she's gonna be in communications and writing , Mhm . she can't start from zero base . ... Mhm . Gotta start from somebody . Right ? .. Mhm . Um , Mhm . .. and whether that somebody is , ... Emily Dickinson , or , ... um ,   She sure is interested in a lot of -- or George Will ,       4..   uh God forgive me for saying that late at night but , George Will ? She was- reading George Will ?

And  , Well I'm six at the moment , and then , n- next week I'm gonna be seventy , ... um , ... and I told you the joke about Nixon and , ... uh None , Mhm . ... so , .. you know , we all get that age , right ? Mhm . .. Mhm .  .. Well in time . .. As it goes . Here you are . Mhm . I gotta check on everybody , and see how everybody  -- You're so very kind . Yeah . ... No , I was um , ... you gave me your history , I'll give you sort of mine . ... Thumbnail . ... I was brought up on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota . ... In which one ? ... On the Pine Ridge . ... Really . In South Dakota . In South Dakota . Are you an Indian ? In the Bad Lands . Yeah , but not of that , .. I'm an Osage part .  Really . And I was brought up up there , In in South Dakota ? Yeah . ... My wife is nan grew up in South Dakota . Where . ... In Deette ? ... Eastern South Dakota ? Mhm . (%) Eastern . D- well mine was totally west . Yeah .  In the Bad Lands and , Of course . Yeah . Yeah ? Sure .  Over in the Black Hills , Yeah . and I lived there , until , ... I was -- ... Well I lost my family when I was about eleven , so I went to live with this other  family , Mhm . And then I left there in .. fortyone . .. Mhm . ... Came down to the eastern part of the state , and worked for a construction company , ... uh went to Oaklan- -- Eastern part of which state . S- the Dakotas or here . This state . New Mexico . Down around Roswell , or Carls -- No , over at Tucumcari . ... Okay . And then I worked for a rancher over there for a while , ... followed the rodeos for a while , Mhm . .. .. uh , ... and at that point , I went into the Navy , .. in nineteen fortytwo . .. Mhm . Um , .. never got .. past .. furgot Idaho , ... and they discharged me , ... because I got injured , ... and , ... from ... there I went to , .. White Sands New Mexico , Mhm . ... and , from there I w -- ... I was in the Army . .. At that point . And after that , I went -- Oh they got you in the Army . Yeah , they got me in the Army , after I -- Even though the Navy threw you out . Oh yeah . ... Um , ... either the Navy was not as fussy , or the Army really didn't care , ..  which amounts to the same thing . When did you go in the Army ? ... Nineteen fortythree . ... Well , ... And then , .. after that , I worked at Los Alimos , .. Well how long you stay in the Army .  .. Uh , ... two years . .. And did you go overseas with em ? Or , No , .. Hmm . .. No , it was in the States the whole time . I was in construction , .. Mhm . and , so that's why , uh White Sands Proofing Ground was important , and that's why Los Alimos .. was important , because I f- .. fulfilled a need that they had . Mhm . ... Then at that point , I w- got out , and I went back to , ... the University of Michigan , I thought it was very important that I , go to a big ten school . ... Is this Ann Arbor ?  .. Ann Arbor ? Yeah ? Graduated from there , ... um , ... b- got real homesick for this part of the country . ... Came back out here , went through law school at the University of New Mexico ,  this was just shortly after they had started law school down here . Mhm . ... And have basically been here ever since . Hm . And I have been in the uh , .. oh I was in construction work , .. and uh , had a construction company in Albuquerque , and , Mhm . a variety of thi- -- How'd you get to , how'd you get to be a judge . .. Uh , elected . .. I see . Stood for office ? .. Yep . ... In nineteen sixtyeight . Is that a nonpartisan vote in this state , or is , No , w- w- well it is now , Yeah . um , it- -- At that time it was a very partisan type of a vote . I see . And I , ... it was real interesting , because uh , ... I had never been in politics before . I see . I had never been involved in it . Course this is sort of Democratic state . ... It was the Democratic State , So you stood just as a Democratic , As a Democrat . .. Right . for governor . Right ? Right . For -- For judge rath . And ran against four other Democrats in the primary , Mhm . and uh , I had worked very actively in the Bar Association , Oh I see . and , so I think because of that , Where was your , where was your private practice . Albuquerque ? In Albuquerque . Oh I see . Albuqurque and Santa Fe , uh , Mhm . part of it was in Santa Fe . Mhm .  .. And um , so then um , .. I was on the appellate court here , .. in Santa Fe . Mhm .  Which is the statewide . .. Sure . .. A state-wide court , ... and then , when I retired from there , at the end of eightysix , I , ... uh , .. managed a law firm , .. uh here in town , but then , quit after about , about two years , and have been , ... uh , sort of doing what I was telling you earlier , .. acting as a judge in a variety of cases that people select me . I See .  What law firm were you managing uh , Wescott Barry and McCohen , .. Uh , that's the big outfit next to the , ... uh , ... The temple . temple . Yeah . .. Yeah . Sure . .. Right . I see . And um , ... but I have really , probably , in my whole life , have enjoyed the last .. two years , more then anything , in being , ... um , ... a judge , and a final arbitrator , in a variety of types of cases , where I am selected , and , they don't have to take me if they want me . .. Y- or- if they don't want me . Sure . I see . And , and , that part I really enjoy . Because , I know when I , when I get a case , ... it's because they want me to hear it . ... Okay , Y and- -- both sides .  And that's , .. you know , it's a little ego part , Yeah . .. Sure . No it's a big ego part .  But I really enjoy that . Yeah . Okay . Medium ego part . ... No it's a big one .  Okay . Big e . No e- -- Biggie . Ny- -- No it's a big one .  Because , Okay , good . you know , if b- -- If both sides want you , why , ... and so that is , is really sort of my uh , Yeah . And is your wife here tonight ? Yeah . ... That was her that came out -- Oh , she came over to see if you were still here . Yeah . ... Yeah , if I w- -- Well no . Y- if I was alright , and hadn't passed out and fallen over the wall . Oh , okay . .. Oh for heaven's sake . Uh , ... judges in New Mexico don't do something like that , do they ? ... M , well , I'm not really a judge , uh I'm a retired judge . In New Mexico .  Oh . .. Even retired judges don't do that .   .. Oh yes .  Yeah . 2.. Okay . Heavens , yes .  Ah . Good . Ah . ... Heavens yes . ...

Yes you are . I am , .. I am not mean to you all the time . ... Look how mean you're being . ... None Well look how mean she's being None . Jenn you're cruel . Look . Oh that's wonderful .  3..  .. Guilt . Looks uh , Lisbeth . Mom it looks so good . So good . It looks lovely . nan ... You know , this family works on guilt . The engine of this family , is a little guilt motor . That goes vroom vroom vroom .    I don't agree with you . I totally agree . Right . I don't -- And -- We're making you feel guilty , 2 I totally agree  , but what , 3 You totally agree with yourself , what are we -- Totally agree ,     5..  Jennifer , you're agreeing with yourself  . Yes . I agree . 7.. She totally agreed with herself . ((LAUGHTER) I totally agree with me .   ((LAUGHTER) Boy if that isn't conceit , nothing is . That's why it's not believable .      I totally agree  . Such a great statement .  Fill in the box . It's like giving yourself a survey .  . ((LAUGHTER) .. Right . Agree with yours- --   .. Do you think you're a wonderful person .   4..   Yes . Check .       I totally agree with myself .  Yeah . Do you think other people are miserable . (COUGH) (COUGH) Mhm . Yes . Check . Do you agree with me .  Yes . Check .   Shut up .           .  None We three , we're all alone ,  2..  living in misery , None Living 3.. sery , There's -- There is a fine line , my echo , my echo , my shadow , my shadow , (COUGH) and me None . and me None . ((LAUGHTER) There is a fine line though , between guilt and responsibility . (COUGH) Like you're feeling a responsibility towards people ,  Ah . Mm . And the feeling of guilt , to make yourself do things . Mhm . Right . And I think that line , is really fuzzy but I think , often , .. Talk to me . The guilt .. strings are tugged 2.. very hard . That is the biggest crock of shit I have ever heard . No it's not . None Often None . 4.. You and I have had a talk about this before . You're not an orphan . ... No . Well I happen to think yes , Now tell me , that guilt is a very massive part of this family . Jenn- w- -- What happened  . ... 4 Guilt for  -- Guilt , no , she's right to a certain extent . ... Bullshit . This family -- is ,   2..    To a certain extent . How do you -- I qualified . Bullshit . We believe in guilt . Bullshit . .. You don't think this family uses guilt ? Well 6.. I -- 6.. The trouble is , a little guilt goes a long way . Long way . Especially if you're Jewish . .. Yeah . Do you think -- And you guys feel a little bit guilty , about the way you've treated us all these years of life . Oh what a crock .    ... Now guilt works two ways . That's bullshit . ... Now I've been looking for the May seventeenth New Yorker . Oh please , 6.. Mother , I've learned , Hm . ..   ..  She's like ,  out there . You're , Liz , Liz , Are you in this conversation or not . You're None outre mer L . I hear it .   I hear it .  Hunh . .. You hear it . None You're uh duh . Oh I think , Mom ? .. Uh . Wait . My gla- -- I have m- -- I have -- I just go without glasses on ,  I need  -- ... Mom ? .. What . Here's the deal . ... You guilt me , ... and in response , I guilt you straight back . T- -- .. In response . None To guilt . .. That's now a verb . That's like Tara said today , It's a new verb .  To beguilt , to -- to w- -- ..  Uh , .. Got -- I'll water you . Said , I'll water you . I'll water you . .. Cause , .. she's gonna sprout you know . But , like sometimes , what I'll say to you is , you'll you'll start guilting me ? ... And what I'll do in response , is I'll say Mom , you're guilting me . ... Whereupon you immediately , Gilting . That's putting a little coat of gold on top isn't it Gold . Yeah that's right . That's right . Correct . That's gilting , not guilting .   None  Excuse me ? ... Liz ? ... Sort of like .. airplane and , ... what's , oh plane and plain . That's it . ... Um , .. Mom ? Yes . Oh and plain , ... and plane . Oh , maybe this is it . Um , ... that thought , whereupon , you , like , ... develop .. guilt . ... Well I think what Jennifer said .. is correct . How do you separate ... responsibility ... from .. guilt . ... Well if you have no feeling of responsibility , no amount of guilt will appear in your head . Exactly . ... Guilt , .. in- in fact , .. the distinction between guilt and responsibility is , you must feel that you have responsibility , that you have failed , In order to feel guilt . then you have -- I agree . It's a little bit like sin and confession . guilt . You have guilt . No but then , somebody , but , but that's , Mhm . Mhm . Can't have one without the other . that's exactly , that's exactly right . This thing is leaking . There can be somebody who makes you feel like you have a responsibility , Liz , this is moving . In a case , when that is not necessarily clear . None Ah None . So guilt is not the issue , Ah . the issue is a denial of responsibility . No no no , no , you totally turned what I said around . None  where I set those . There's an ac --  agent there , who is making you feel responsible , for something that you are not responsible for . Well how could -- Then you don't -- .. Responsibility is not --  to how you know you're responsible .  -- is not an objective phenomena , Jennifer . It is often when they have been defined . Unless you've signed a contract . 4.. No when there have been defined responsibility . .. Right . For exam- -- Okay . In most human relationships , there are no , .. defined , written in in in -- Monogamy is a good example . ..  In uh -- What what what are we talking about now .  No , Monogamy . I'm just talking about -- Why -- I'm trying to think about family ,   Trying to make me feel guilty ? situations .     I'm tro- talking about family situations ,  I'm talking about like set- -- .. Cleaning up after yourself . Or doing things , that you have clearly defined , as rules in this house , That is correct . as your responsibility . Oh excuse me ? .. Is that bad ? As -- Whose responsibility ? As -- 3.. No no . As your , our . Wait I want to go back to this monogamy thing . The individual person .  What is --  What is that ?  ((LAUGHTER) No , I'm just trying- -- I was just trying to think of examples , of what are assumed , APPLAUSE but never , assumed , but never 7.. delineated . Good question . And therefore , if it's assumed and not delineated , .. does responsibility exist or not . ... It does . .. Ah . Good . So we have -- Wait wait . I'm losing -- Except -- I -- ..  Responsibility -- Assumed -- You lost half of us back  .   Responsibility can be either assumed .. or .. asked , like , Or explicit . certain . There seem to be three categories . ... There's no responsibility , ... Assumed  , there is responsibility , but it's inarticulate . .. Or it's articulate . That's right . Two categories . Okay ? Right . So now we got , we're all together now ? And so when -- When there is -- So wait , can you have guilt for all three forms of responsibility . Should I get a blackboard ? No .  No , and I'm saying , and she said that , I'm still confused . she's saying ,  We're not talking about guilt , He's still confused about monogamy . I'm sorry , I'm dumb .   I'm sorry , We're we're not talking about -- She says , g- oh , we're not talking about guilt , we're talking about responsibility , and denial of responsibility , and I said no . We're talking about somebody who makes you feel responsible , for something that is not necessarily always going on . And I said to her , how do you know , What was this about . 2.. what your respon -- ... Her statement about , we'll walk back and -- Well I came over here ,  and she- -- I said , I looked at her chocolate , I admit , I was making  . None We have to go back to where they were . 3 I looked at her chocolate  , You can't just -- Back to the setting . I bought that chocolate , None I looked at her chocolate None ,  6..  I said mm , and you said , you can't have any of my chocolate ,   None you've got to be nicer to me , if you want some of my chocolate .   And then I said , ... what ? And I said , what am I not nice to you None about . That- -- That's a -- 2.. Did sh- -- That's a statement of guilt . A way to    . 5 Responsibility  . They --    5 Dad but wait a second  .

Quite right , it's like when my father used to say ,  ..  .. you'll be sorry when I'm dead and gone .  Exactly . Please . ..   But do you n- .. don't think she has a responsibility to be good to me ? Fuck you . .. But , .. No , Wait a minute wait wait wait . the implication is she's not . Oh no no , Wait wait wait , whoa whoa whoa . Wait a second . Apropos something Jennifer said in May ?      The implication is that , she's not good to you , That's right , but not everybody has agreed with that implication . Wait Lisbeth . you didn't -- Lisbeth .

Lisbeth , apropos something Jennifer said in -- Oh , wait a min , what did you do at the checkout counter . None Whoa None , None apropos something Jennifer said in May , Well wait . You know Liz , Ma , we have to hear this -- None Wait wait  I None --  None Will you let Leanne finish None . Did I  ? Wait , None time None . Can I say something . Jennifer and I and Dana had a huge argument in May , which created a rift for about a day . ... Which was b- .. concerning you and grandma . ... No not in May , because I wasn't here in May . Oh , let's not start . .. Mhm . Let's not start . ... What , what about the checkout counter then . None But that's responsibility None . You were about to , you were about to correct my mother , So , so , on something about the checkout . Well I , I think there is a -- Uh you see , What happened at the checkout counter . What hap- -- We wanna know . Mom says I pounced on her ,   And all I did , this is what I did . I don't know what happened . I went Mom ? ... Calm down . And then -- No , I didn't say it loud , I just went like this . I said , Y-  , sh- such a lie . None   Did I pounce -- You said- -- Such a -- 5.. I was None -- I didn't see what happened in the checkout counter , None What None ? None I do not None pounce on you . I was gonna offer an opinion about the d- -- .. the d- -- the disagreement there . About ... the .. uh None What was she doing there why you -- the trust . The trust involved . Do you think that's TRUE any . Yeah . ... Yeah I do think that's TRUE . But it was not about Jennifer , it was about the lady . Right . But I , I happened to agree with Jennifer . Because it reminds me of all these old people in the supermarket , .. who are standing there going , .. are you sure that's twenty one cents , .. or twenty two cents . It's programmed into the computer . I ,  2..  3..  None the lady specifically said , ... to hold off with putting things on the counter None . Mom .. was getting a h , was starting to hyperventilate ,  at the checkout counter .  There were so many objects going on the counter . None It was making her crazy .  9 Just so many objects  .   9..  And it was not clear ,  None ... for a little , None few minutes there , what was already rung in , .. .. and what was not rung in . And I did not want the lady to get confused , and ring in items more than once . So she -- And she specifically said , .. not to put everything on the counter . Okay . Well then , I didn't , I didn't know that . Yeah , and so what happened . .. .. Starts putting everything on the counter . No , ... I w- -- ... Acts like I'm a child , like I'm just throwing things on . I was not . No , There was an order to how I was doing it ,    It was yeah . One at a time . Yeah but Jennifer . As- -- One person's order is another person's mess . No .  ...  Especially if you look in my bedroom .  Mom was starting to hyperventilate , about something that did not require a breakdown , .. and I was trying to pat her on the shoulder , Ts- None  It looks a bit -- And I said to her in the car , and say it was okay . that this language , ... just makes me angry . ... This exaggerated language ,  Ts , ... What does this have to do with guilt ?  ((LAUGHTER) ..  Right .  2..  Right . I don't know Rich . Or monogamy . What does it have to do with monogamy . That's what I wanna know . None Yeah , I wanna None come back to None the monogamy thing Jenn .     ... That was .. a slip . ..  A slip .  .. .. Where did that language of exaggeration come from , Uh , You know what , there's two sides to this . as a joke ? Uh , Cause it's my disease . And , Mimi Fogarty is like ... the biggest ... perpetrator of it . Mimi Fogarty- -- You don't exaggerate . Oh . .. She d- -- Oh . You're very cautious . ... It seems to me . But sometimes I do , cause when I'm around other people , I .. tend to talk like them , Well None -- ... just like , .. just little jokey things , just like , ... Yeah but that's just , with numbers and stuff . Jennifer , That's how you make humor . That's how you make humor . Yeah , that's just humor . Jennifer and Lisbeth are hyper ... uh sensitive , Like I told you twenty times . to one another's language . ... So , if Jennifer says ,  . ... uh Mom , ... Lisbeth hears , ... a lot more into it .. than Mom . Right . ... And if m- .. Lisbeth says , ... Jennifer , Jennifer , Jennifer hears .. uh .. paragraphs . Yeah . Sure . ... So there's a long history here . ..  Nine of that paragraph  is guilt . Well that -- That's like Leanne's , And then --    , We'll have very short sentences .  The button that you gave me . Don't look at me in that tone of voice . We'll write very short letters to one another . Did you have that with your mother though ? Right .  The other times -- Well that's a possibility . No . She didn't talk to her mom . .. What Ma , what were you saying about me and you ? ... That button you gave me , With this like , don't look at me in that tone of voice ? The tone of the voi- -- Yeah like ,  I don't .. really  think None , ... It's TRUE . No . ... It came with the valley girls I think . Everything's ripe with with , ... hidden meaning . ... Where it started None . ... Start what . ... That ... way of j- speaking . Just like , Mom ,  like I don't feel like , people say that and I   -- Jews ... said that in the nineteenth century . ..  ...  .. Ah , just expressing my- -- What time is it . None In the evening , Annoying it just , Expressing what ? Oh about half an hour since you last asked . Richard , .. This is hot . Ten twenty five . Ten thirty . ...

I'm so tired . ... Tired . It was -- It was okay , I left my bag there . ... I left my bag , and all my money , and all my things . ... Now the ghosts'll get it . They ca- -- ... Ghosts'll get it  , ... that's okay . ... ... Um , ... ... ten thirty , there were probably .. thirty people in the store . ... Good grief . We're like , ... okay , it's time to go out now . We're closed . We're closed . ... We are closed now .  .. Please leave . ... Turn on the fire alarm ? I -- ... Turn on the fire alarm ,   that would do it .  (BUZZ) ... These kids were- came in , and , ... I was .. like , w- we're closing nan . In a few minutes , they said , well we'll -- We'll wait until you kick us out . Cause they didn't really want to buy anything , they just wanted to look . Mhm . And I said , okay , ... we're closed . ... Out .   And , ... so I was moving them , like making them go out , Mhm . and they were .. trying to be cute , and .. say sweet things , and -- ... To stay in . .. Yeah , lots of student types , ... Yeah , ... there are a lot , but there are mostly families , so in terms of being uh , Mhm , ... umm , ... and so , ... kids said well , ... are there any oth -- What time's it , eleven ? I said , no it's .. ten thirty , it's past our closing time actually . ... And , they said , well are there any other -- ... That what are the other bookstores open in town . Now . I'm like ,  come on .  It's ten thirty . .. This is the latest thing open besides ice cream stores and bars . Mhm . ... And , some other guy came in , ... I felt kinda bad , but , ... I guess I'm glad I said what I said , there's some guy came in who -- ... N he looked like a student , sort of a student type but , .. ver- nicely kept . ... Friendly .. looking . ... And basically needed a place to stay because , ... he ended up in town with twenty dollars . And , I mean , ... couldn't get to Amherst , cause of no car , and no buses , and , ... no hotels that were open and , You mean buses weren't running then ? ...  .. et cetera , Hmm . and he wanted to know if .. I knew anyone who would ... put him up . ... And , ... I .. referred him down to Paul . Cause .. I just , and then , I felt like , oh I wanted to , Mhm .  but 2.. at the same time I thought , well that's a better thing and should we .. talk to John about ? ... Mhm . ... And I also .. just wasn't quite comfortable ? ... Mhm . But at the same time , I would have been comfortable I think . ... So , ... I don't know . ... Je ne sais pas . ... Oh the other thing I found out , I h- was returning the book on uh , cohousing ? ... Uhuh , ... And um , ... Paul ? ... And , ... well , first Paul said , oh I have this friend named Sarah in Hart- in Hartford , and she has this place ... that deals with coop , ... what's it , ... co-op initiatives ? ... Mhm , And um , ... they s -- Oo . ... I'm sore . ... Oo . ... She .. deals a lot with .. alternative kinda housing , and cohousing , and .. housing .. for the sake of people and stuff . .. Mhm , .. So we were talking about that , ... and then while we were talking about that , ... um , ... a lady came to buy something , ... and , ... she s- gave me the name of this other -- This Amherst architect , who s- -- ... started two co-housing developments , in this area . .. Hm . ...  It was just so funny to , and nan , ... Jen and I .. put a note in the log , (COUGH) (COUGH) Mhm . in the book check-out thing ? ... Mhm , ... By my .. the -- So I wrote down the name of the book to check it out , ... and she put a note said , ... oh neat , I've got a friend who's in a co-housing place , in .. Denver . In like Colo- s- -- .. I think it was in Denver . Uhuh . ..  ... So it was pretty wild . ... Uhuh . ... I have to pee . ... Okay . ... Oh -- ...  my shoes first , ... I'm so tired . ... So so so tired . I didn't buy any books . I couldn't decide what I wanted , and then , ... things just got too harried and I , .. just didn't think it was the right time to buy a book . ... Mm . ... ... We got more stuff ... for your dad . ... What kinda stuff . ... Umm , ... computer access .. places . ... Like places you could .. plug into ?   -- Plug in to get email and stuff . or -- .. Aw . ... And I also , ... fiddled around and , figured out how I can get .. things to print out two on a page . Oo . ... S- take up less paper ? ... Unhunh ? ... You need a magnifying glass , but , .. No I think it's okay . ... In better light . ... Yeah we have to get a light . ... Y -- Oo I have to go to the bathroom really bad . .. Here . Okay . ... Take this back . I gotta take my sock off . ... Be right back . Yes lighting is an issue , that needs to be addressed in this house .   ... So , .. it seems like a fairly basic one . .. That we could address fairly .. easily nan , I was thinking we should walk down sometime to h- -- .. to the umm , ... eeya eeya eeya , .. to the lighting place , down by  , Mhm , why don't you just go . .. Well because I wanna -- .. I wanna do things orderly . ...  .. Sorry . ... ... Scott ? Mhm ? .. I used the rest of the orange juice , but I put .. the container back , ... in the fridge . ... So that we don't have to wash it , you can just make more orange juice tomorrow . .. Okay . ... So far , the cheapest place I found in here is , in Portland Oregon . ... How much is it . ... It's like six dollars a month . ... That's okay . ... ... Mm . See the thing is , this light , ... it's cute there . Mhm ? It's not particularly practical there , I mean light does come through there , .. but if you're gonna sit there and read , you need light . Next to it . ... Well would it work to put it on the other end ? ... It wouldn't be as -- It wouldn't be as aesthetically pleasing . Mhm . ... Right . ... ... That radiator tilts . ... Mhm . ... Hm . ... ... (HUMMING) ... So I got to look at the copy , .. of umm , ... it's Dante's .. Inferno . .. Mhm . ... ... It's a new translation , .. with twenty different ... contemporary American poets ? ... Got different cantos ? ... Mhm ? And translated them ? ... And so it's neat . .. Cause there's these poets that .. I like . ... And they've done translations . .. Mhm ? .. Of these different -- Of the different cantos or , cantos or , ... whatever toes . ... And um , ... they , ... well it's expensive , it's expensive but it's hard cover . ... And it's nice . ... And it matches kind of this , ... bath book , this scented bath book , that I wanna get . .. Mhm . And I wasn't pla- -- I don't really .. need it , ... the Divine- -- I don't need either one , ... I wasn't urgently planning on getting the Divine Comed- -- The -- The Inferno one . ... But , the way they look together is very nice . .. Those two books together . ... So I was thinking it's sort of an aesthetic thing . ... That it would be nice to get them together . ... At a time , ... I'm gonna have a little vacation , so I can sit in the bath and , have my scented bath . And then I could .. read . ... Mhm . ... ... I do realize it's a little bit ... far out , ... it seems like there's -- Danielle said we need to , ... the Alexandra Stoddard book back , ... Uhuh . They returned -- I think they returned the one -- The Creating a Beautiful Home one . ... The one that I had that had the , ... the blue and red writing ? Oh , .. uhuh ? It's not there , it's not in our inventory anymore . ... Maybe it means that -- Uhoh . ... Maybe the paperback's going out ? And so they wanted to give the hard ba- cover back ? ... I don't know , I was very disturbed . ... Uhoh . ... I can always order another one if I need to . .. Is that a program you're reading ? .. Hm ? ... Hmmm . ... Guess it's a -- It was just a list of uh , ... places that offer emails for- .. service , and different things . Oh well that's good . ... Oh , ... you know maybe if we could turn the spider plant around . ... Which one . ... The one that just looks kinda decrepit . ... That one . .. Yeah . ... Maybe we could -- I think it , ... would probably do better , if it got its babies trimmed off . I mean can it wait ? ... I think we thought about doing that in the springtime , ... then I thought we'd replant them . ... Yeah , but I think there's more babies than ... we need . Would -- ... Yeah . ... And we've got three new babies that I could replant , but I haven't , ... already . Unhunh . .. And that -- .. Yeah the -- The other plant over there is , ... has lots of babies , ...  ... Oh , I looked at Orlando today . ... The book ? .. Yeah . .. Do you think you want to read that together ? ... That interest you at all ? ... Unhunh . ... Cause if it -- If it really wouldn't , if you're just saying that to make me happy , then , No , I thi -- I didn't n yeah . I'm , ... I think it probably would , ... It seemed like it would be fun to read out loud . ... And I don't wanna start it if we're going to read it together . I don't want to start it on my own , I wonder if .. if it would be , ... any less .. abstract ... than the -- ... Yeah there's a lot more conversa- -- More . There's a lot more in the book . .. Like the part where she falls on the ground , Could be .. easier to follow . .. and says , .. I am nature's bride , .. Unhunh . .. she also says several other things . And there's also .. commentary .. from the narrator . Unhunh . After that . .. Unhunh . So I kinda like the movie better that way . Cause it's , ... gets the point across . Unhunh . .. Simply . ... So , ... yeah , there's more in it . ... Your basic account from Near Net is two hundred and fifty dollars a month . (COUGH) (COUGH) ... That's a lot . ... That's who ith connects ... to . Well if you're ith it's one thing , Use the Internet . if you're dad it's another . Actually it's the five colleges . Oh , Oh , I wanted to call Jenny . but it  -- ... I do want to call Jen . ... Well you can call Jenny . ... I'm tired . ... Mm . ... Maybe I'll call Jenny anyway . ... Jenny anyway . Jennyany . Jennyany . ... Jenny Garret . ... Cause I wanted to ask her .. about ... the , Hm . ... magazines she's had . ... ... Did I tell you that ... the woman .. who does -- ... This book here ? ... Monsieur , ... nan ... Unhunh ? This book here ? ... Okay she did the art .. here ? ... And other art ? Uh it said in here , that she does .. clip art . For .. different kinds of .. ... liturgical things . ... And I found there's two books , ... listed , under her name , besides this one . .. But they are clip art books . .. Mhm . ... One is for feasts and celebrations . And one is for something -- They're like that . They have neat .. titles . ... You just need to get yourself a clip art book and a scanner . ... And a scanner ? What would I do with a scanner . .. And then you'd like load em .. into your computer and make your things with them . Aw yeah , then I wouldn't need a Xerox machine , and tape and glue and stuff . ... Yeah . .. See then you could . You could scan them , and then you could , make ... them different colors , and sizes , and .. things like that . ... And you could do neat things with them . ... Different colors and sizes ? I'd need a color .. printer . ... Yeah ? .. Yeah . Little minor -- How much is a color printer ? ... Umm , ... you can get a color version of the printer I have for , gosh , I don't know , ... five hundred dollars ? ... Would it be good ? ... It's .. reasonable . ... Look at this . .. When does this go to . ... We have to go far away away though . ... Three hundred ninetynine , gracefully styled , Queen Anne wing .. recliner , with cherry finish legs . Do you wanna .. Queen Anne wing recliner ? ... Hmmm . Why not ? I already looked at those . ... You didn't like them ? ... Not really . .. You get them in different colors Scott , ... you don't have to get the high aqua . ... And I could probably get -- ... Reclining love seat . ... Reclining sofa . ... Since when have they started that . ... Don't you remember , we looked through like Sears catalogues , and stuff like that , and there was these , ... Oh yeah . really amazing complete things , you know , with .. built-in tables , and storage , With refrigerators , and refrigerators , and coffeemakers , and , ... and , ... all that sorta stuff . Oh , I'm tired . You know a ... sofa with a built-in entertainment center . ... That's amazing . Can we throw this away ? ... Mhm . ... You sure you don't wanna get a huge big bed ? ... Monsieur ? ... Mm I'm sure , I am happy with ours . ... You're sure you're happy with ours . .. Mhm . ... That's good to hear . ... What time did you come home ? ... Eleven o'clock ? ... Mhm . ... What time is it now , .. After eleven o'clock ? .. Mm back . Cause it's been a while since I came home . ... ... Mm . ... So I'm gonna be rich this week . ... It's like eleven twentyfive . ... ... Aeya . .. Still too many books . ... What to do . ... What to do . ... Scott , we were going to read this accompaniment book . Remember ? .. Which one is that . .. Oh . The one from , ... mm . Chu , uh -- Chu , ...  Chu . Yeah . ... It's kinda neat , cause it's got little .. articles by different people . ... It's another one that doesn't take t- .. a great deal of attention . ... My very own ith Alumni Quarterly . ... Alumnee ? .. Alumni- -- Mm . Alumnee . ... I re -- .. I remember when we graduated and , .. we got .. full explanation of all the variations on that . ... ... They started off by saying that alum is , ... a chemical . ... It is ? Not a graduate . ... Alum ? ... Alum . ... Alum ? ... Alum ? ... Alum ? ... So . ... A Color in Your Garden book . ... Oo . ... See what her name was ? Who wrote it ? ... Who ? .. The person who wrote it . .. Is who . .. Penelope Hobhouse . ... You should come over here . Where it's lighter . .. Mhm . It's lighty . Then we would have to move . .. To do that . ... I should have more water I think . ... I actually would have to move for that too . Mhm . Oh , .. my life is so hard . ... ... You finished the spinach . ... Mm . ... Oh , ..  . ... ... Scott , .. Mhm ? There was a very all .. tiny screamy skwa squishy . ... In the store today . Screamy sk s -- Well I heard it . Oo .. I .. I just heard it . I couldn't see it . .. Mm . ... It's like its parents were hustling it out .. the door . ... That would be water . ... Do you wish for my water ? .. No . ... And Emma . ... Maxine's little girl . .. Unhunh ? .. She's -- ... She said things to me today . ... She looked at me , .. she iled at me , ... and she talked to me . ... Wow . .. Those are all three new things . ... Cause usually she goes like this . ... Whenever she sees someone she doesn't wanna look at . Oh . ... Or one she doesn't know . .. Right . M -- .. She  everyone there except her mom . ... So her dad brought her in . (HUMMING) She came behind the counter . She said mom I'm gonna sit here mom okay ? ... Maxine said okay . ... I'm gonna help you mom okay ? .. This kid's like two and a half . And she sang all her ABC's , ... she's -- Maxine said they took her to the fair yesterday , and she won some prize , that , .. these older kids couldn't win . .. She's a very bright kid .  ? ... And um , ... but , .. I asked Maxine if she was , ... like uh did she like having .. kids , and she said oh yeah . She wouldn't ... give them up for the world . ... Mhm . And she said , she wasn't planned , ... but , ... now , she just thinks she's great . ... Mhm . .. And she said , after Emma started saying her ABC's , and I said , wow , it's amazing , that you're not even three , and you can do your ABC's . ... And Maxine , .. and like , I iled at Maxine and said , .. I said , what's my name . ... And she'd say , neat , .. Mhm .  . ...  .. Excuse me . ... This is very amazing . ... (HUMMING) Well um , we got a new coloring -- ... A new coloring book  , a new Christmas book in . ... Unhunh ? At the store , ... it's Christmas songs ? ... Mhm ? ... And there's lots of them Scott . .. Lots of Christmas songs , in all different languages , ... and then they're translated into English . .. And it tells about them . .. And I think we should get it , what do you think . .. I don't know , I haven't seen it . Well the cover's not very pretty , Well I'll have to go see it . but the inside is a None -- Well I have to see the inside too . Well you'd better come tomorrow . .. Okay . You should start writing Christmas songs now . I'll come visit you tomorrow at work . Yes . ... That would be nice . ... ... It's not that bad ,  something else , or do you want -- actually . Well ten seventy -- Yeah . No . You want em -- .. Just take em out and , .. That's great . take em again . Yeah . ... There's that , Better get twelve hundred . 3.. and , That's what I want . .. I mean , ... Here's this , So , cause I think ten seventy's way too low .  Erika would you , For 4..  -- follow Dale out , and just hand him that     ? Sure .    . 5.. Thank you .  .. So I have to take them again , .. um , You can just put that over on the  , I have to ... send them money by the eighteenth , for ... SAT's for the October exam . Put it on that railing over there . Okay ? ... Mm . So , STOMPING I'd better get twelve hundred on these . Have to get twelve hundred STOMPING .  Well if you ... study hard , .. You can't study for the SAT . Get your rest , (%) no , but you -- Well , they say yes you can , because they have all these groups that say , that if you take their classes , and they go over the test , No . .. Mom , .. Mom , .. Mom .  you can raise your points , you can raise your points a couple hundred points . The SAT , the SAT board itself has said , Yeah . ... Yeah , but that's just by learning tricks . I know what the tricks are . That's all you need to know . .. Teach them to me . The only way you can -- But what you have to remember is 3.. that , The only way you can score high is if you read a lot . That's all . what you have to remember is , You can't study  . that the SAT is not a whole measure of who you are . None Oh I know None . It doesn't measure your creativity , it doesn't measure you know so -- Mom , I know . Mom . I'm not saying that . But I do need to have a better SAT score for applications . ... So I wanna bring it up . .. What'd you say your score was ? .. Ten seventy . ... I'd be happy to get seven hundred . Well you'd only taken it once so . ... Yeah .  ... I think Claire took hers a couple times . What ?  I said I'd be happy to get seven hundred . ... I .. I mean , .. yeah , people in my school when I told em my score were like , .. oh , you won't need to take it again , but then like , my friends who have like thirteen fifty on their SAT's , Who's that . But Stephanie , Yeah , but I mean you can- you can't compare yourself . you cannot compare yourself , you are uniquely you , Mark ,  -- You can't do that . John , Glen , Glen got s what . Glen got fifteen seventy or something like that , Stephanie , you cannot com- -- I was like you make me sick  . Stephanie , But don't you be like Glen is . you can't compare yourself . I know , Glen has to .. like ... get dates through the computer . How do you think I feel when I get around Glen . When you learn that you can't compare , you'll really be grown up . You are uniquely you . No , I mean , .. You are not like anybody else . I -- 2.. But Mom . You have to accept that . The reason I am saying I need to bring them up , and the fact that other people have higher scores , ... is that , .. I do need to bring them up from ten seventy , if I wanna have a better chance at getting into colleges . Where's your bathroom at ? Right around the bend . It's not all they look at though . Or upstairs . One or the other . Yes , But it's one of the things that a lot of colleges use . I'll find one .  Right around the bend .  Well , you know , Or you can go upstairs if you want Erika , just uh -- 2.. Well ? with all those guys sitting there , Well it's on -- I can't  -- I should look around and 4.. see what else is -- Go up to the top of the stairs None go straight ahead , 4.. What else is there . .. and you'll see it on the right . Okay , There's a good see -- How about this school called Adrian College in Michigan ,  -- Yeah , It's real -- it's in Adrian Michigan . not very far from uh Ann Arbor . ... They sent you a lotta information . .. Sounds like a neat school . But , .. they don't have a lot of -- It's a aller school . 2.. I had a really good book that I should give you . They don't have that many majors Mom . ... I wanna go to a school that has a .. large variety of majors , and so if I change , I have something to None look at None .  You have to remember one thing , Hm . and and I don't know , maybe .. maybe Gail could None talk about that , OU had a good art department . Gail went to a big school . A big school was very different than a all school . Now Aunt Maureen went to a aller school , Mom , I want- --  well they bo- -- Now wait . They both have advantages and disadvantages . Both of them . .. You have to see which ones fits your personality best . Oh I know . But Mom , That's it . 2.. of my personality , .. even Claire said , that she thinks I would do fine at a bi- --  .. Don't take Claire as an authority . I'm not taking her as an authority ,      Ah  Believe me , I've lived with Claire . I'm just saying that --  .. But Mom , if I wanna go to a big school , that's my choice . If I'm willing to pay for it , yes . It's cheaper to go to a university than it is to go to a private school Mom . ... Depends where you feel comfortable . Uh , I have a platter , When you get on a campus sometimes I think it might , 2.. you can get a platter for that it's -- Gail might say , Yeah you have to go , you have to go out and visit and then . you feel like , 4.. hey I like this place , I think I could belong , or you think , .. I don't I don't feel comfortable here . I don't feel comfortable here .  And that's what has to be your final goal . Oh yeah , I know that . A place that has what you want , but you feel good about it . But , You walk on campus and you think , hey there's something about this place , I'll dump this outside ,  that , .. that speaks to me , I had one college that did that . you know , you don't know that until you're on the campus . I had a college that did that , Mm . but I would nev- -- I can't get in , cause it's just too impossible . ... Duke University ? Yeah . Duke . Yeah . I fell in love with that school right away but , Well , .. you can always apply . Apply , that's TRUE . Absolutely . Yeah . ... But , I don't know if I'm gonna bother , cause it's like a seventy- application fee , ... and .. the chances of me getting in there are like .. zilch . .. So , ... What , .. what do they require . ... Ih , .. the people that .. I have met .. that have gotten in , had ... four point o's , uh , .. fourteen hundred on their SAT's and uh , Well kiddo , you had a chance to study , you know , I mean that's -- ... basically , they .. they were in like , Kept telling her . the three clubs like , the Young Republicans , Comes you know , when it comes down to the you know , uh ,  ... some uh like business management and something else .  (%) None Past performance has something to say about that . You know . ... But Stephanie , I've been telling you for four years , you've gotta work hard . Mom , .. Mom , Mom . Gail understands . .. I don't wanna hear it .  Good old BU . ... Good old BU didn't want me . No BC .  . .. BC . They didn't want her . They didn't want me .  She snowed the interviewer , but they still didn't want her . ..  .. You snowed the interviewer ? ... The interviewer was so goodlooking .  Ha haha .   I love it  . He was this young attorney . .. He was real young , and I had my interview in the US Steel Building . .. .. And I went up there and , ... but -- .. You know what , they asked me some really weird questions though . I know . I know . They did , Like they -- I expected to go in there and talk about , you know my life , and what I wanted out of a school , and what I expected from them and , So what did they ask you .  They asked me .. what my stance was abou- on abortion ? ..  Boy that was a dumb question , that's one -- Boom . I was like 3.. (TSCH) , That's a controversial question , so I would think that's a dumb one to ask . Well , It's controversial . Well they asked me that , .. and they asked me , And personal , how I thought about drug testing in the workplace . it's very personal . Very personal . Those are both personal questions . You know what ? 8.. Williams did the s- -- Well , you know what's funny is , you know , BC is ... a Catholic school . Yeah . And I th- -- You know , .. I don't think they really liked my answer ,  but uh , That's -- .. But you have , Well , 3.. but you still have freedom of choice , You know what , That's right . Yeah , I mean ,  Williams is the same way . Cause Lee went , and , Lee applied to Williams . And she got waitlisted . .. And Williams used to be really lib- -- ... liberal whatever . .. But lately , .. the information they're sending out is , a nice value community uh , moral stance , da-da-da-da-da I mean None , There's nothing wrong with that ,  Well no , but what they're do- -- that's important . But , but m- Mom , what I'm saying is , I'm listening . ... They had , ... years ago , .. they had the sit-ins , .. everything you know , real liberal , .. now they're going to conservative , and when she was interviewed for it , they .. took her answers .. very .. slowly , and they waitlisted her , she had the grades , .. but she didn't have the political views . And , .. uh , .. that's what was happening . So maybe she was better to be in a place , where she's free to express herself . Oh yeah , Rice , 2.. Rice is great . She , You know , Rice is really liberal ,     , Things work out sometimes for the best ,  as maybe Gail realizes too you know . Oh she's much happier at -- Yeah . .. She's happy in Texas . She's really happy there . .. Where is Rice . .. It's in Houston . Houston . It's right outside of Houston , ... she r- she loves it there . Um , they , their admissions were .. higher than Harvard's this year . ... Really ? ... They have one of the top history departments   . Maureen didn't have any trouble deciding . ... Hm . ... Well sometimes you don't . Some people are lucky , Why , they always know where they wanna be or what and , Why was that . ... I was probably .. the hardest person to find a school for ,  -- because everyone , ... in my family , knew what they wanted to major in . And you weren't sure . Immediately . And Stephanie's not sure either . And I was kinda like , yeah , I was like , She has some idea-  -- well , Yes I am , .. Well , What're you gonna be . ... I'm gonna be an art historian . She- -- I thought she was gonna be a short-order chef . That's what she --  Well she has no experience at that in my house .  A professional griller . ... I have it at the store ,  Stephanie , A manager of Tasty Freeze . .. what are you going to w- -- What are you going to be ,  2..   An art historian . Isn't that what you    , A what , Well an art history major . ...  Depends on what I minor in . Art . .. I wanna be a social worker . ... Oh what an excellent choice . I have to determine my minor . Probably be good at that .  I kept telling Stephanie , that's what she should be , and she loves to talk to people , that's where she should be , and she's -- But if I am a -- Hey you could be in human resources like me . Hey , pour me some more of that , I'm not going anywhere tonight .  -- .. You can be like , in human resources like me .  Not driving . That's right , cause we're taking the car later . I don't have to drive home . Hey you know what , .. Speaking of that , are the keys in the  . I have the best job on earth . So if you wanna get into something good , No , I didn't bring your set of keys . I have keys . get into what I'm getting into . I drove here , I have keys . 5 Oh that's right , you did drive here  . It's it's , you know , I could've drank anything . Well I think the th- important thing that maybe we should all say to you Stephanie , and you need to listen is , you have to keep an open mind . Don't cross any school off before you see it . That's right .   You know , Oh yeah . don't cross off Geneva before you go there . I'm not crossing it off ,  I know it's far away and it's not a big town but , don't ... already think , I don't wanna go there because , It's not far away , .. it's not near a big .. metropolitan area . .. ... nan You know y , nan she wasn't near a big metropolitan area . ... Right ? But , I had thought that I wanted to be near ... big area . But I also went to None high school in a big metropolitan area None . But what but -- But we're saying . So -- But , it doesn't matter though . So did she . I mean , She , I mean , .. she wasn't downtown , I had my access to the city , but she lived in Pittsburgh all her life , Yeah . You know ,  she did the same things you did , But there's -- she went to the opera , she went to the symphony , she went to the ballet , so she grew up in a coopolitan atmosphere . If there's not a coffee house on the campus , .. I'm not going . They None all None have coffee houses , That's -- They all do , that's the latest thing .  .  You know , .. They changed our bar , But what I'm saying is , on our campus , to a coffee house . Don't eliminate a school ,  by where it is , Are you sure -- and what somebody has told you . Are you sure you're old enough to go to college .    Well I'm not sure about that . So far as I know , yeah . I I I graduate this year uh , yeah . Well you know I had some really .. really .. big problems ,   when I first went to OU , for the first quarter ,  but it wasn't , ... It ended up , I wondered if you were gonna tell  . Well None , well the thing is that , Well that's good to share . it ended up not being , ... I mean it doesn't really matter , ... the atmosphere , eventually it doesn't matter the atmosphere , because eventually , it's the people that you meet , When you're ready I need , the professors that you meet , my son-in to reach that platter . your classes itself , Okay . that really .. become important . You know , Mhm , Right . And that should be your first priority . Yeah . Yeah , and that'll , I mean , What you do extracurricular , Where's the be -- Where's that bread that you want nan can't be important . But , Because that's not what you're there for . but if you're not -- 5.. But , Mom , Mm . if you're not happy in your setting , I'll have Jerry get them down . you're not gonna be happy with where you are . I'll tell you what kid , if you're going to college to have a good time ,  one year is all I'm paying for , I'm not going to college to have a good time . the rest is on your own , Dale , I already told you that . Dale , ... But it's like , it's a proven fact that , None No that's alright . No , here . I know . people work better in a comfortable situation , Exactly but , than in an uncomfortable situation . 4.. extra -- 4.. But you don't have to be near a big city , Aunt Maureen wasn't beer- .. near a big city . Mom , .. it's a little different . I'm .. a different person . TRUE , I like city life . exactly , I have always liked city life None . Then stay here and go to Pitt , it'll be very cheap . No .   I like city life None away from parents None . I like -- I like that . 7.. Could you imagine Gail , it'll be very cheap . Why don't -- Why don't you look at , Honey you'll be away from parents anyway . ... No , in my opinion , Let's look at -- Let's look at cities . What kinda cities do you like . Do you like big cities , like a Chicago ? Or do you like a Pittsburgh .  She's never been in a big city like Chicago . She couldn't identify with that . You were in Chicago Steph , when we went to 4.. Easter . None I've been in Chicago None . When . .. Pittsburgh , or Chicago , Easter break . Two years ago . Chicago and Pittsburgh are very different . That's right , but what did you do in the city . I'm gonna give you -- Did you go downtown ? Shopped , we went to the biggest mall , 6 Yeah we went shopping  , That's all you did . You can't shop when you're in college , you'll have no money for that . ... Ask Gail . You will not have money for that . Mom , I drove around .. LA . That tells me what a big city's like  . And that's pretty scary actually .    No . .. Friday night , at nine o'clock , on Hollywood Boulevard is not a place to be  . Okay . They couldn't find the uh --  No it wasn't that . We knew where it was , we just didn't know which exit to take  . But , .. didn't get there . What were you looking for . Universal Studios . ... They got there at nine thirty . So we miss it , ... They had tickets and got lost , No , it get -- It g- it's it's a funny story . she and Samantha Taylor . You have to hear this --  Oh really ? Yes .  ... Samantha and I go out , She what ? She and Samantha Taylor get lost . ... Samantha knows where they're going but can't get there . Well let me tell the story None .  Go ahead , tell . You don't know , because you weren't there . I wasn't . 2.. I was 2.. in the car . That's right , I heard it later . ... So we're driving and , we went and , .. How do you put up with that . We missed the exit . ..  She said , .. oh , It's hard . well we'll just get off at the next exit . Takes a lot of patience . .. Yes it does . And , turn around . Could be the hardest thing I've done in my life . ... So we got ... off at the exit , .. and , it was the Hollywood Bowl exit . She goes well , no big deal . Except , .. there was a Hollywood Bowl going on that night . Oh no .  So here we are , stuck .. in this huge line of traffic . .. And we wanted to turn around , but you couldn't make a left turn because , they had parking going on . So you had to go all the way down , ... so we go all the way down and we hit Highland . ... So we take Highland and , ... we end up on Hollywood Boulevard . ... It is nine thirty at night , .. we're on Hollywood Boulevard , .. and it's Friday . ... Not a place you wanna be . ... Now we're trying to find a place to turn around . Reminds me of the scene in Valley Girl . We drive by the Chinese theater , Yeah , that one  , Yeah . Yeah , you know ?  Why didn't you just go to the Chinese theater , but you had tickets , Yeah , (COUGH) Right , we had , we had free tickets . That .. her mom won on the radio . .. Or on a raffle or something . Oh that's neat . Oh . So , ..  we're going down , They can't get there .  Well it gets -- It's not funny . I know , this is just the beginning . ... So we're on mo- -- We're on Hollywood Boulevard , we're looking at ... all kinds of interesting things ? .. And we're like okay , we gotta turn around . So we find this --  We had no streets . That we could turn down , except for this one alleyway . ... So we turn down , in this dark alleyway  , and we're turning the car around , Oh my god , good thing I didn't know this . and we see all these people in the alleyway , we're like , get us out of here . She backed up . ... So we're going back , and we get to the ... Hollywood Bowl , and we're stuck in traffic , you know , Sam's going , I hate LA , I hate it . She's screaming , I'm sitting there , and some guy's looking at us . And he keeps staring , and we're like what are you looking at . We're just lost  .  .. So , .. we get back on the freeway , ... we're like , sh- Sam's like , I know it was the exit before this one . The big one ? Yeah . Whatever you can reach up there , I know that was the one it was , any one of them will do , okay , let's go . there's one on the top that's fine . We go off the next exit , That's -- and we see this huge sign , that says Universal Studios . That'll be fine . But there's .. no arrow . Ah ,      We're like , okay well , I guess that means we just go out this road . .. Thank you . So we go up the road a while , You're welcome . ... we're driving up this road and , ... all of a sudden we see Warner Brothers Studios . A sign that says , ... city limits of Burbank . ... Looked at Sam I said , Sam , we're in Burbank . And she goes ,  We're not supposed to be here  .    Turn around , That's what happens when you let two seventeen-year-olds go off on a Friday night . come back . So , now we go over ,  and we see the sign that says Universal Studios , and we're like , well it has to be around here somewhere , it's right here . So we go across , Isn't that in Burbank California ? Universal Studios ? I thought it was in Burbank . Yeah . It .. it's ... outside , it's like right next to Burbank , .. but , That's , .. that's where uh the Love Connection is though . We'll get to it , My favorite show . it's   ,     No no , I liked That's a More . ... Yes , That's a More , Oh that one I don't know unfortunately . The one where like they bring in their infat- -- or , infatuation , when they bring in someone they're infatuated with , and they ask them out , and the person either she ts- -- sh -- like turns them down or goes out with em , Oh , that's that one guy , .. from the soap opera . Dean ? ... It's -- Dean from Another World , No , that that -- Yeah . Is that it ? .. There's two , No , that's another show . No , that's that's the new one . Oh okay . 4.. Oh ,  There's like eight of em . That's  yet another one . Well , Oh my God . so we're turning , and we see this pizza shop , and it's still open , and we're like , okay . ... Go in , we'll ask him , since the sign's right across here . We go in , and we're like , w- -- .. Excuse me , but do you know where Universal Studios . Well it said on a sign right there , we're just like well there's no arrow pointing . He goes , .. yeah there is , ... the arrow is the last three inches of the billboard . And it's on the ground . ...  So there's a bush . .. Covering this big yellow arrow . You couldn't see it . ..  We get to Universal Studios ,  it's ten o'clock , ... or no . It was -- ... Nine thirty I thought you said . It was , it was nine forty five or something like that , and they closed at eleven .  Oh no , We got on one ride . They spent all night trying to get there .  We're on the way home , I was like  , ..  let's not take another detour . She's like , Unh-unh  .  What did you go on , while you were there then . We went on the Back to the Future ride . ... Simulation . On what ? Oh really , .. Back to the Future ?

Okay ? Stephanie said to me on Friday , this is an historic day . I started my first day as a senior . I said that is historic .  ... This is the beginning of the end for me , You get to make fun of freshmen . if it ever comes , the beginning of the end , ... if it ever comes . .. It comes Jan- -- ..

They'll be good carriers . ... And , I'll put this out , and we're ready to eat , ells good , Okay , So , ... How are we ever gonna find a school for her .  ...  .. I'm gonna pray a lot . ...  That she makes .. good choices . Uh , ... it'll work . She's .. very opinionated . ... And her dad's very patient with it , and I get really hyper .  ... After a while . ... But , ... that's why I said you know , you can't ... prejudge . You have to go and , .. feel and , .. visit and .. say , oh yeah well ,  and then keep a list . Okay .

You just uh , you know , so I don't know how to prejudge . ... I'm just gonna hold my breath . ... For the next six months , I'm gonna hold my breath .  ... That works . .. Right ? ... I don't know , I could die from holding my breath .    Then I wouldn't have this problem though , Uncle John would have it . So I won't have to do this  .  Maybe that's , not such a bad idea . Hold my breath , then he has to deal with it . ...  ... Here I am , see if she's  -- But I am getting better . I've been laying down , Well Dale will help her , I've been putting my foot down on things like , See if she trusts a drunk . you know , .. cause Stephanie has futzed around with her health class , Let Dale help her please .

And that's where it's fatal . And I was like , well , .. you know , What about brain damage . ... That doesn't matter or , ... Mmm . Excuse me brain damage is important to me . ...   He said actually fevers ... are -- .. How did he explain it , he said something like , fethers -- Fevers are like , ... um , .. .. good for babies like , when they're i- b- getting sick , because they help .. the immune system fight harder . Somehow . None Well that's what the -- I don't know , ... I mean that's what -- The reason the body gets that hot , is like to kill the germs or whatever I think . .. Isn't that part of it ? ... Yes doctor Kevin , tell us .    .. No I'm pretty -- I'm pretty sure , I'm pretty sure that's part of it , but uh it's just that you have to watch out , cause then , if it gets too hot it's bad for the brain . It's like a car , it overheats .    And stalls out  . Maybe , I don't  -- I -- Are you gonna stall out None jito None . I'm not None sure . Don't stall out on us . ... Who's all the babinos . ..

And then there's other kids who go , na-na-na-na-za-ba-da ? .. And there'll be a word in there somewhere ?  ..  And there's a -- COUGHING ... Oh , Don't freak out . ... Are you okay ? Cause I tickled his feet . ... It's all my fault . .. Give him a drink . .. It's he drinks too fast . .. It just went down the wrong pipe . COUGHING ... You need to burp ? ... ...

It's funny cause , h- he'll be like , he'll get up in the morning , he'll sit in front of the TV with his bottle in one hand , just watching TV ,   like half asleep , you know ,    he's a ,  and I'm like , Go . While ago he was sitting here , If you lay -- and he was watching the football game , Like his grandpa . ... he was watching the football game .  ...     4..  That's low , Issac- -- Bottle in one hand , half asleep ,  7..     watching TV ,   8..  8 That's low  . 9  this picture  . 9.. Thanks a lot ,  you witch .    2..  What ? You witch . It's TRUE  .   Aw , None Jito None . you're dwibbling . .. Dwibbling ? Uh dwibbling . ...  ... Gross . Um , Oh . try not to spit all over here . Baby slobber , ew .   ... You  seen it was gross ,  Michael , Michael's shirt was all wet , from right here ,   from him just drooling .  ... It was gross ,   Probably he was opening- -- and we took him to the  , .. Breathing through his mouth more , cause he couldn't breathe through his nose at -- Mm . .. And then he couldn't even breathe , he had , ... um , ... they had this .. thing , it was this big old long old tube , Here . ... and it was funny cause , like , .. we could -- (COUGH) (COUGH) .. They put a mist , Child , you're having problems . And you could just see like oke , .. you know , like a mist , like a humidifier , coming out and I was like , Mhm . Mhm . and I was all --  Out of his throat , I mean then where'd they put this on , in where did it , No , they stuck it in a tu- -- It came out of a tube , and I just had to hold it like , around his face , Oh , oh okay okay . so that he could -- None Come here None . It was oxygen , ... but they put a mist in it , so that he could -- They didn't want to stick oxygen tube up his nose , or put a mask on him , cause he'd .. take it off . .. Mhm . (SNIFF) And it was funny , because every time like he'd see a person wearing blue , he'd be all , and he'd start like , not breathing ,  Oh   and then he'd like ,  poor  -- And then it would sto- -- And they'd be all okay okay , and they'd walk out of the room , cause they didn't want to excite him , cause they didn't want him to .. hyperventilate . Poor thing .  None . Yeah he's doing better . ... And then the doctor comes in , and he just looks at him , and then they stick this fing- -- thing on his finger ? ... It's like light sensored ? .. And they have to guard it from the light , and that's what measures his heart rate ? .. And it measures .. his oxygen .. percent , how much oxygen he's getting . Wild . .. Cool ? .. It was weird . And he was all in -- Did his oxygen get low ? Or , Yeah , it was like eighty-six percent . Yeah ? .. Which -- Of what's -- Supposed to be like ninety what ? A hundred . ... Um , adults are probably -- Like ninety okay I think . ... Adults are supposed to be anywhere from like ninety-three to .. on up .  You gonna .. go down ? ... But anything -- And you ha- -- Babies higher or lower . Yeah , None Gonna go on the floor None ? babies are usually higher , because you know they (%) -- None Are you mad at Nina None . They haven't been around as long .   So she -- Yeah , so , he was really not doing well . No .  Nobody should really be that low . 4... I mean , 4.. people that are that low there's , 4.. they have asthma and stuff like that . None Hee hee h- hee hee None . They like -- Yeah . Or emphysema . None .. Ha ha ha ha . ... But he was -- And his heart -- What was his heart rate ? .. Two o four . .. And it's supposed to be , ... I think he said like one sixty-eight or something . Well , .. babies are supposed to have really high heart rates . But one sixty-eight versus two o four ? That's still scary . ... And he'd just do , he was doing it , .. when he'd get really excited , so that's why they were staying away from him . .. .. And uh , we had to hold him down for them to give him a shot in his thigh , .. A shot , why'd they give him a shot . ... To make the swelling go down in his throat . ... Oh , did he get it in his bottom ? ... No , right here in his thigh . ... How is he about shots . ... He cries . Probably not good anymore .      I remember the first time I took him for a shot . None You know he was just little ,  He did not care at all . He's all ,  happygolucky . None Dee dee d-dee None . He was all , None aah , ... aah , like that . And then .. after that it was okay . ... And then like ,  ...  That's good . the next time I took him he's all , I was all None oh my God .  And then I picked him up ,  and his legs were bleeding and stuff , and I had blood all on my shirt , and I was all oh my God  . Blood-  -- Blood , cause he bleeds . ... After they give him a shot ? But don't they , like put a thing on it right after ? But that much ? ... No , but it was just coming out . Do you know what I mean , it was like , mm , Well they should've have put , I mean usually you know like when you like give blood , A bandaid ? But it wasn't all over , they use , it was just like , .. a little dribble . It had -- Nyeah no , it had .. gotten on my shirt , and I was just all oh my God , Oh , ... my child's bleeding . ... Baby blood . ... Baby blood . .. Watch out for that glass . He's .. looking at it . .. ... I'll trade you . Is it mine ? See I'm not supposed to give him juice in a bottle . ... He's supposed to drink it out of a cup . .. Why not . ... Oh cause all the air ? He -- ... No , No cause -- .. they're get baby bottle tooth decay . ...

And -- And it was nationwide . .. Mmmm . ..

No no not slick .. top , .. just like , you know like , any old-looking car , ... and then they ... take that wire , and put it on top or whatever , or in their , ... the front part ? Anyways , and um , ... and would pull people over . And he was wearing like a -- like , .. you know , like an .. shirt ? You can .. buy em like .

Something she just said , well Jesus is in your heart , not on your forehead . Or something .  And I was just like --    I was just like --  (SQUEAL) You told me that , but it's still stupid . I mean -- It's just like , well , you know , you just proved that you absolutely know nothing about the Catholic religion .   . You know what I mean ,  That was never the point ,     you know ?  .. So whatever . ... I was just like , Oh boy . Oh , it was so funny one day . Um , .. uh Kent was ... at the .. store . And me and Cassie were talking , and I was just like , ... that's before he fired Barry . .. I guess . ... Hm ? He y- that's the day he asked us about Barry . ... Asked you about Barry . Yeah .  . Cause that was the day he said he was gonna fire -- Well he had told us that he probably was gonna let him go , Well what happened -- Okay I never -- I'm nan I'm gonna get you off subject right here . .. Barry was mister wonderful good , ... did everything -- He never was . He never was . I thought Kent .. even said that he was great . Well , Kent liked him at first . And then he started messing up the machine and stuff , so Kent was like , Unhunh . you know , So he didn't like him ever for very long . and then he  -- Unhunh . And then , Oh , okay .  Pat started not liking him either . ... And I mean , my mom never liked him so , ... Okay anyways so ,  But he -- We were sitting there , and you know how like , .. Kent's like a big old -- Well he was a big old drug addict and all that stuff ? And --  You told me a little bit about . Yeah , he was a big old drug addict . Yeah he was . Like coke or . And he -- Yeah . Yeah , he was a born-again virgin . I thought that was the most hilarious thing I heard in my entire life .  But he -- Anyways , I'm sorry .  But he was , you know , he like , is so like , judgmental on other people now , he's gotten to be like that ever since I think , basically since he's been married . He's like .. so judgmental on people , it bugs me . .. Like who . B- just like , ... people in general . I mean he just , ... I don't know it's -- .. It's weird . Like ,  See I -- you know how he used to always say , well I would never push , my faith on anybody , I would never .. p- preach to anybody . But , ... he doesn't let us put anything up . Like as far as , you know like um , ... Can't put anything Catholic up ? Or nothing secular . Yeah , do you know what I mean , just .. nothing , we're not allowed to put anything up . But , here comes this person , and -- And it's .. about , .. like you know , ... about his religion or whatever , and he CLAP plasters CLAP it right on the front door , you know , and he's not pushing on his customers and stuff ? And we lost a lot of customers because of that . Because they didn't feel like , you know , .. that was a place for -- What -- What was it . I forget , it was an announcement of somebody coming , a speaker or somebody .  Oh , Oh . I think I remember that . And he -- And -- And he -- .. And they were just like , not really -- ... Well he used to , ... like , you know , Leave little prayer cards at number ten , Bar- -- Yeah , Barbara , had this sh- -- .. They have , they call em -- They call em tracts ? ... And what they are is they're like -- Like they'll have Footprints on it , .. or um , I can't remember . ... Just little thing -- Little prayers , and stuff like that , and -- But she had a little basket , and it said take one or whatever . And um , .. right by the thing . And she'd wear her little pray pin and , and then she put , you know , happy birthday Christmas on the window , I mean happy birthday Christmas ,  happy birthday Jesus .  Jesus ,    . she still did . I know , it's on this year too I saw . ... But and I got -- You know some customers who , it's not that they weren't Christian at all . .. You know , it was just , it annoyed them . ... Well you told me they were gonna s , .. they were gonna , .. turn it into , they were gonna have a religious .. card section or  ? They were going to . Yeah . They were . .. That would've been wild . That would've been -- You know you're -- Dry cleaner slash religious card dealer .  That was  --   Yeah ,  he -- That would've been so strange .  I thought None everyone would be like , ... Well the- -- And then you could add a drivethrough , you know let's say I need , you know , give me my clothes and , you know , .. Pick up a card on the way . Two bapti cards  -- You know . And a birthday card for --  No they wouldn't have a bapti card Kevin . No I know . I've been trying to think what would they have . ... That's like pagan or -- Jesus loves you .    ..

He just thinks we're weird  .    Kevin , it's not an instrument . ... Don't -- ... No uh , he's uh .. li -- What's wrong . He sick of that ? Who's this weird person in my house . But anyways , I was talking about his drug problem . Right ? Oh I'm sorry .  It's how he's so judgmental -- A long ti- -- ... None -- Uh Marie ? Uh excuse me , don't --  That's my couch .       ... Um ,  Oh my dad doesn't live here . It's your chair . .. But .. um , Shut up .    ((BANGING) 8..  ... See I told you . None Oh None . ... But he um , he was like really judgmental and -- And we were sitting there , Nanananana . .. (SNIFF) and he had said something about , ... something that had to do with the bar next door to number ten , None Boo None . you know , people who drink . .. At one time or another . And I couldn't remember , and so that day me and Cassie were talking , and I , and .. she like , was like , .. she was like a little runaround . You know , she used to like , ... Was or is .

And , .. um , .. she like , w- w- was in a -- So she must have been going to Utah when she was like fifteen , or something . Yeah .  Cause she was doing all kinds of like -- That's scary . Oh my God . I assume her parents really appreciated that . And -- nan Well , they were like , her paren- -- Her mom's like an alcoholic , and stuff like that , and her dad's like a biker now , and I'm like , God , you know , Oh . but they're not married anymore , but still . Well we were sitting there talking , and she's been in a center for like .. rehabilitation and stuff , .. for drugs and stuff , and we were talking , and .. I , .. nan and I told her , do you get offended , I go , do you think that it , you know I told her , do you think it's fair , that when people say nan , .. y- you know that , ... even , .. y- y- like , you were an alcoholic . They never say you were . You're always an alcoholic . You're just a recovered .. alcoholic . Do you know what I mean , a recovered alcoholic . Mhm .  But when , .. when you're a drug addict , and you don't do it anymore they say , oh , you've come clean . Do you know what I mean , I go , that really bugs me and and , and Kent was in the back , I was all , I think a person who was a drug addict , .. once was a drug addict . Always is a drug addict . I said , they're just a recovered drug addict . And I was saying it like  really loud . Like on purpose though ?  .. Yes , so that he would hear me . .. Oh . And I was all , because that's not , that's not fair I mean , alcohol is just , .. is a drug too , and I was just going off , and stuff like that ,  and she was  , .. like agreeing with me and , and , and then , I was all , .. just being real like ju- -- None Que hace None .

Yeah . Do you know what I mean ? Yeah .   I would never say something like that but , Just to sh- kinda show him how it is . like , .. Yeah , what it feels like . how judgment- -- ... And I was just going off and off , and you could just , Did he react ? He did . He just did really quiet . And then he's all , uh Marie and Cassie , can I talk to you for a minute ? And I was all , oh my God he's gonna fire us None .     (SCREECHING)   He wouldn't fire you .

Oops . ... ... So uh , Sharon didn't get to see her mother ? . .. Okay folks , we're coming to a short stairway , use the handrails , and be careful please . Okay folks , let's find out where we are . ... We got on the elevator right here , .. came down and stood on the balcony overlooking the power plant , ... down that stairway , out on the power plant ramp about that far , then right at that yellow line . And you're now standing over the second-largest water pipe in the world , and it's called a penstock . ... More about that a little bit later . .. The Colorado River , flows in this direction . In order to build a dam here , the very first thing they had to do , was to get rid of that river . .. So they came up here above where the dam was to be built , and drilled and blasted out , four diversion tunnels . Two on either side , into the canyon wall , around where the dam was to be built , out in the river down below . Each one of these tunnels were drilled and blasted out at fifty-six feet in diameter , and then lined with three feet of concrete . .. You're now standing in one of those old diversion tunnels . ... They then came up here , and they built a cofferdam about a hundred feet high , to force this river into these diversion tunnels . Came back down here , built the other part of that cofferdam , about sixty-five feet high , to keep this water from backing into the work area . They now had from here , to here where they could build a dam . .. They pumped the water out of this area , and excavated down another hundred and thirty-five feet to bedrock . .. Okay folks , if you will please , take a look at this picture taken during construction , .. looks like a series of boxes or blocks , stacked one on top of the other , .. and those are wooden concrete forms . Each one of those forms are exactly five feet high , but they did vary in area somewhat , because they did not build the dam right straight across the river , from canyon wall to canyon wall , they built it in the form of an arc . ... And it's called an arch .. gravity design dam . Where the force of the water , coming down the Colorado River hits the face of the dam , and tends to try to drive these wingtips further into the canyon wall . .. It's a very strong design . ... They did build two concrete mixing plants here , they did pour concrete for twenty-four hours a day , seven days a week , three hundred and sixty-five days a year . For two years , .. less ... six days . Now every bit of that concrete came down in individual eight-cubic-yard bucketloads . Eight cubic yards of concrete into one of these forms , the allest of which is twenty-two by twenty-five feet , only filled that form up about three or four inches deep . .. So there goes that story you may have heard , that there are workers buried in the concrete here . .. Couldn't possibly happen . .. But what they did bury in that freshly poured concrete , was one-inch steel water pipe . .. They came down here in this lower cofferdam ,  and they built an ice plant . .. Capable of making a thousand tons of ice a day . They used that ice , to chill the water , that they forced through that pipe in this newly placed concrete . .. As concrete hardens , or cures as we call it , it produces heat . ... The more you can control that heat , the better job of curing you're going to get . .. So they used the chilled water method , of taking that cold water , forcing it through that pipe in that newly placed concrete , picking up some of that heat , then carrying that heat out and away . .. They felt if they did not use a method such as this , .. that it would've taken approximately one hundred and fifty years , for the concrete .. in the interior part of the dam to cool down . .. So the system did work . ... And then it hardened , and they remove these wooden forms , .. they left voids . Vertically and horizontally these forms came together , those voids were filled with grout . Under high pressure . ... Grout being a mixture of concrete and water . ... When this is done , you have what we call a modified monolithic pour , or basically a solid block of concrete , which when completed would be six hundred and sixty feet across the base , fourty-five feet across the top , twelve hundred and fourty-four feet from wingtip to wingtip , seven hundred and twenty-six point four feet high . ... Six point six million tons of concrete . ... That's enough concrete to build a two-lane highway from New York City to San Francisco . ... Or , put another way , a four-foot wide sidewalk from the North Pole to the South Pole . .. Then they had to protect that concrete a little bit , the next thing they had to do then is build a couple of spillways . As you got out of your cars or your busses this afternoon , you may have noticed those spillways . Here they are , one on either side . .. What they did , is they came in here , and they blocked these diversion tunnels off in this area through here , ... closed these gates up here , now this yellow part is forever under water . Underneath that lake out there , and completely useless . But they did incorporate , into the design of the dam , the balance of those diversion tunnels , .. using these outer two as spillway tunnels . Now these spillways were built , so that the top of the spillway , is twenty-seven feet lower than the top of the dam . .. This assures us that n- any excess water coming down the Colorado River , rather than overtopping the dam , overtops these spillways on either side , goes into the canyon wall , around the dam , out in the river down below . .. Each one of these spillways is capable of handling two hundred thousand cubic feet per second of water . .. That's the same amount of water that goes over Niagara Falls . .. Falls three times higher than Niagara Falls does , time that water reaches this area down in here , it is flowing at between one hundred , and one hundred and twenty miles an hour . ... Okay we have protected the spillways , now they had to get some water , .. nan into the power plant . ... What they did is they built four intake towers . Two on either side of the river , on ledges above the river , each of those towers that you saw out there in that lake , ... are three hundred and ninety-five feet high . ... Each with two-eleven-by-thirty-two-foot gates in them , one gate near the bottom , one about half way up , to let the water in . The water then coming into the penstocks , like the one we're standing over right now . ... This penstock , you can see on either side of us out here , is three stories high , or thirty feet in diameter , made of two-and-three-quarter-inch steel boilerplate . .. Made in section twenty-two feet long . .. Each section weighing approximately a hundred and fifty tons . Each of these twenty-two-foot sections is joined to the next section , using pressure pins like this . .. The water pressure in that penstock out there this afternoon , approximately two hundred and thirty-four pounds per square inch . ... Okay we have the water this far , now we divert that into thirteen-foot penstocks or water pipes , each one of em going to a turbine . ... The force of the water turns the turbine , which turns the rotor in the generator , and generates power . ... The water then coming on the tailrace , we saw it up there , and going on downstream to be used at least .. six more times , before it reaches the Mexican border , to generate more power . .. Good clean .. reusable non-polluting source of energy . ... The cost of the project . ... A hundred and seventy-five million dollars . ... I say project , because that includes the building of the dam , the building of Boulder City about seven miles up the road , the highway and the railway from Las Vegas out here to the dam site , and in southern California they built the All-American Canal , which takes water to the people and the crops , .. of the Imperial and Coachella Valleys . This money was borrowed on a fifty-year term at three-percent interest , and was paid off in full in nineteen eightyseven . ... The people who worked here , and they did work twenty-four hours a day , average twenty-four-hour work force was about thirty-five hundred men . .. The most they had at any one time was when they were pouring concrete , fourty-three hundred men . ... The laborers on the job made fifty cents an hour . .. Highest paid man on the project was a power shovel operator , at a dollar and a quarter an hour . ... Out of each man's paycheck , the contractor did deduct each day , a dollar and sixty cents . Because the contractor was feeding , and housing the men in Boulder City , and taking them back and forth out here to the job site . ... They did have ninety-six .. industrial deaths . .. The biggest single category of death was classified as falling material . Basically falling rock . ... But they did have some killed by explosion , some by drowning , some by electrocution , and other types of accidents you might expect to have . On a job of this magnitude . ... They did complete the project , two years ahead of schedule , and under budget . Started in early nineteen thirtyone , completed in late nineteen thirtyfive . Just twelve days short .. of five years . ... Do I have any questions . ... What's this overhead pipe here  . The overhead pipe . That's the fresh air pipe . .. ... In the summertime , the temperature of the air outside gets to be as high as a hundred and twenty degrees . So they bring that fresh air in , and they pass that fresh air over a sump at the base of the dam , the water in that sump is a constant fifty-three degrees . It cools that air down to between sixty-eight and seventy-two degrees , then they force it back throughout the dam . So it's air-conditioning without refrigeration . Like a big evaporative cooler or swamp cooler . ... Any other questions . ... Yes . ... Uh , during the uh ... earthquake this morning , do you have any sensors down here , that .. measure any kind of movement , of ... structures , Right . ... Yes . .. W- v- we have several things . .. First place we have three seiographs throughout the dam . We recorded those , but nobody down here felt em . But we do have sensors , built right into the concrete , any movement that concrete makes , .. is measured and recorded . ... And they had very little of it this morning . Very little . ... Any other questions . ... How far are you sending electricity . California ? .. Okay . .. Fifty-six percent of our power goes to southern California , twenty-five percent of it stays in Nevada , nineteen percent of it goes to Arizona . What the government did , is they got together the delegates from those three states in nineteen thirty . To allocate the power that would be generated here when this dam was completed . .. California was growing very fast at that time , so they asked for and got most of the power . .. But by the same token , Las Vegas , about thirty-five miles up the road here , at that time , was nothing but a watering stop on the railroad . No hotels , no casinos , we asked Las Vegas to take five percent of the power we could produce here , and they agreed to do that . ... But that's all they get today . Because that contract is good through the year two-th and seventeen . .. So all those lights . You see burning up there in Las Vegas , comes from power from steam plants , owned and operated by Nevada Power Company , using fossil fuel . They get very little of our hydroelectric power . .. Okay folks , you can follow me now , I'm gonna lead us out of here . ... ... Okay , here we go folks . Quite amazing . ... Y- yes it's a fantastic job they did down here . Yeah . About how many people are employed here . Now . ... Right now there's about two hundred . .. That includes the security people , the guide force , the nursing staff , the people that .. run the computer room , the office force , as well as the people that work on the dam . And that's a twenty-four-hour figure . But that figure is becoming aller every year , because every year we are becoming more highly computerized . ... ... Okay folks , there's a tour group coming in , stay to your right please , stay to your right . Stay to your right folks , tour group coming out . .. Okay , if you would , right up this stairway , when you get on the balcony , wait for me on the blue couches on the balcony please . ... Anybody needs the elevator it's available . Anybody that needs the elevator it's is available . ... Come on . Come on then . ... Up the stairway if you can  . .. Up the stairway . That's -- ... Up the stairs . ... Okay , here we go . ... Hi . ... That was the .. turbine over here , off to the side -- Yeah , that's the turbine runner . You bet . ... That's a ... computer design made of stainless steel , it's designed in such a way , there's one of em running at a hundred and eighty RPM , .. it actually lifts that eight hundred tons up a quarter of an inch , for your main thrust bearing is the very top of this .. uh structure right down here . ... This is the rotor . ... The rotor and the .. runner , .. have come out of our A-Seven generator , what happened we lost a water seal down there . So we had to pull those out to fix that water seal , they'll be replaced within a couple of weeks now . .. Oh I see . .. That rotor in that part of the shaft weighs five hundred and eighty tons . WHISTLE Okay folks , if you will please , follow me now . .. Hey  , How you doing ? Good . Okay folks , while we're waiting for the elevators , does anybody have any questions . ... How long have you been doing .. these tours . About five years . .. About five years . I've retired twice , can't stand retirement so , come back to work at a fun job . Oh . ... Anybody have any questions . ... Yeah , .. Ben , ... water comes down the center of the , .. where your shaft is , .. goes out the turbine , ... No . Goes around the dam . Water comes into those towers , .. goes around the dam , comes in from the side . Each individual turbine ? ... Yeah ? The water drops in the center where the shaft goes in , then goes down , No no . .. No . .. It comes into what they c- -- It comes in that thirteen-foot pipe , goes into what they call , the ... area of the wicket gate , ... and there -- And there's a .. pipe around that wicket gate , and that pipe goes from a thirteen-foot diameter , down to a three-foot diameter , goes around that wicket gate ? ... Okay . Right ?  It picks up speed . By the time it enters that ap- -- goes out that aperture , that three-foot aperture , it's traveling at fifty-seven miles an hour . .. But that's what drives that big turbine . It goes around the shaft . It doesn't go into the shaft area at all . ... The wicket gate . nan All the water goes in through the wicket gate . ... It's coming in .. underneath . Yeah . The wick- -- Perpendicular , (%) Th- (%) well , perpendicular to the shaft .  and (%) None yeah . The generator's sitting on top . A- i- okay . 3.. The shaft is like this , and water's coming in like this . Right . That's what I thought .  And then it goes around like this , Oh yeah .  and then out . Now that thing we saw down laying that , uh , alongside , Okay . with the uh , looked like a -- That's a , nan that's a r- turbine runner . We call . Turbine runner . That- and that's , is that is that , .. kicked up on the side like that , the water , ... No , .. it just .. lays .. it -- Spinning it around ? .. Oh you mean the one d- on the floor down there ? Yeah yeah . No that's laying flat like this ,  and the water drives that around this way like this , Oh you're right  . and drives the turbine up there yeah . And that's down inside the uh , .. in the turbine . That's way down -- Yeah . Way down in the turbine . So it's in the turbine . And that's the , Unhunh , yeah . that's what's generating , Yeah . that's what's turning the wheel . Right . ... Right . We were right on that . Right . ... Okay folks , step right in the elevator please , .. right on in , ... step right in the elevator . ... Three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten , eleven , twelve . Thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen , ... nineteen , .. twenty , alright , are you with them ? ... Okay . ... Okay I saved room for you . .. All right , thanks a lot man . You bet . ... Folks this does conclude your tour of the dam , ... hope you enjoyed it as much as I enjoying have you , come back and see us again . Have any questions on the way up , ask Norm . Bye-bye folks . ... Okay , any more questions folks . .. What's the .. story with this tile . ... Wasn't this created by somebody ? Yeah . ... Folks , the dam was built as a tourist attraction , as well as being very functional , this terrazzo flooring you see , terrazzo is marble chips put down in concrete , ground down and polished , this terrazzo flooring was put in here by one Italian family , by the name of Martina . ... Okay there's two and three-quarter acres of this uh t- uh terrazzo flooring in the floor , but the designs you see , is what that Italian family saw nan , and interpretated from southwest Indian blankets and pottery . That's where the designs came from . ... Any other questions . ... Are there just two elevators down , from these two shafts , that'll take you to  -- That's right . .. Two elevators down . Mhm ? The rest of it's just solid . Right . ... Well there are , there are two miles of nan tunnels going this way across the dam . They have a pipe gallery , they have a drainage gallery , they have a -- ... a uh ... cable gallery , and they have an instrumentation gallery . ... And all those things are -- They .. measure constantly the condition of the dam with that instrumentation gallery . ... Y'all open seven days a week ? ... Yeah . Mhm ? ... Is it unusual to , .. to do the generator .. uh ... room .. floor ? In something like this ? There's just -- Yeah . It it's .. in fact , it was built during the depression , and they wanted to make it a tourist attra- -- Make it make it worth talking . It was at that time the largest dam in the world , ... they wanted to make it very nice , yeah , it's unusual . ... Usually you just have concrete decks . Yeah . I would -- .. Yeah . Yeah . ... Yeah . ... .. Any other questions folks . ... Yes . ... What are the chances .. of a leak ? ... Hm ?  What are the chances of a leak . Well , .. it leaks all the time . You see concrete's porous . And because concrete's porous , there's water coming through at all times . But that's good . Because if there're no moisture in concrete , it dries out , and .. spalls and chips , and .. turns to powder . Wouldn't make a very good dam . So as long as that lake is back there , forcing that water through the concrete at all times , it keeps that concrete in a stage of what we call being green . Green concrete's very strong . So we have a good strong dam . ... Say Ben , .. Yes . what's going on up on the hill up here , don't think it's uh -- Okay . 2.. That's a five-story parking garage , and the new building is a new visitors center . .. The five-story parking garage will hold four-hundred and fifty cars . Okay , the new f- visitors center , will have ... three revolving theaters in it , ... it'll have a .. seating area for people going on tour , it'll have a museum , the top deck of that building will be an observation platform , we can look back at the dam in one direction , downstream in the other . Now , when that's all done , they hope to be able to figure , ... to handle .. between one point two and one point three million people a year . Last year we had , .. seven hundred and twenty-nine thousand eight hundred and eighty-nine people go through the dam , but we had to turn people away , almost every night . ... Just not enough time in the day , to get everybody through the dam that would like to see it . .. Hmm . ... Will it have any slot machines in it ? No , but it'd be a good idea ,  wouldn't it .    Pay for this place .  When's completion on that ... parking garage . ... They figure between fifteen and seventeen months . ... Yeah . ... Okay folks , step right in the elevator please . ... Right on in . ... Everyone please face the front of the car None . It's gonna be seventeen more months ? ... Seventeen more months ? ... Everyone face the front of the car please . ... Right to there . None Front of the car please . ... Have they ever had to use the spillway ? Just a minute . ... Okay folks , this does conclude your tour of the dam , I hope you enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed having you , come back and see us again , have any questions on the way up , ask Norm . .. Bye-bye folks . Thanks Ben . ... Have they ever had to use the spillway ? Okay . .. Folks , the question is , did they ever have to use the spillway . .. Yes . Just once in the history of the dam , and that was nineteen eightythree . ... What happened that year , is they had a very heavy snowpack in the Rocky Mountains , .. and that was followed by rain and hot weather , which created a flooding condition . We had more water coming down the Colorado River system , than they could put through the power plant . .. Every reservoir in the Colorado River system was full to overflowing that year . .. On July second , ... water overtopped our spillways out here . Six days later , it was going over four and a half feet high . And that went on for sixty-six days . At the end of that time there was no damage to the dam , or to the power plant , but further on downstream where people had built in the floodplain , they did have thirty million dollars worth of damage , but no loss of life . ... But that flood's what left that white line around the lake out there . ... That white line indicates it was going over the spillways , four and a half feet above floodstage . It gives a FALSE impression , and makes it look like the lake of the level is low . Or level the lake .. of the low . .. Actually we're eight feet above normal , for this time of year . ... Wow . .. Yeah we had a very good snowpack last year . . ... Um , ... first of all , maybe you guys , .. can tell me , ... we talked a little bit about it , last time you were here ? Or did we not , talk about .. the history of the penguins . Thanks . I wasn't here that weekend .   No . No . Okay . We talked about the endangered species . Okay . ... We have , .. on exhibit now , about twenty-fi of the thirty penguin chicks . ... Wow . ..  That .. you have . MIC .. Um , Oops . ...  .. Last year , ... I s- want to say around Christmas time , ... we went down , the Shed Aquarium , as well as other ... researchers and scientists , went down to Antarctica , to collect , .. Mm . Gentu penguin eggs . ... Okay , so , I want to go into a little bit about , ... the history of the Gentus here , .. um , ... for you- -- For .. Don and Lori , where -- Where did our original Gentu penguins come from . ... Uh , Faulklands . .. Wasn't it ? .. Where did the -- .. But , specifically -- Oh specifically , in the islands ? Where did we get them , for display here at the Shed Aquarium . Oh . From the um , .. was it ... Edinburgh uh ... Zoo ? Yeah . ... Great . ... Yeah . In Scotland . Yeah . ... Right . ... Okay ? Are those the ones that ... don't like people ? ... The hands-off ones . ... H ones . That came from -- ... Where's Ten from . ... There . Or is that -- .. Oh okay . Yeah . .. Well is -- What's the other species . .. Rockhoppers . .. The -- .. No , ... Magellanics . Magellanic .  . Yeah . Okay . Ra- -- Magellanics came , from the John Ball Zoo , in Grand Rapids Michigan . Mhm . .. So , the Gentus , .. which -- ... I take it you work mammals as well ? .. Yeah . Okay , .. so feel free to add in , I worked with the baby penguins , .. when , ... cause I've only worked like a weekend , but both days were spent ... with the penguins . Feeding the baby ... penguins and then , ... Ten and , ... all of them . Great . .. Great . .. So , ... feel free , after .. I've go through this information , .. you know ,  share any information you might have , Mhm . Well I'll probably have a lot of questions for you .  from your experiences . Okay . Cause that's , None you know , Mhm . .. usually the best way that we can get , some good detailed information is from , volunteers , that actually work , in mammals . So , we love that . Um , CLAP anyway , so , .. we got .. the penguins , our original batch of penguins , from , .. from this .. zoo in Scotland , and , um , .. you know , as you know , you ship them over , and they go into a quarantine ... period . And , .. I do believe it was thirty days . ... Don't .. don't , .. it's in my ... literature right there , I'll check for certain . Uh , that is required by the USDA , basically there's , ... there's a disease called n- ... Newcastle's Disease , that , is .. is very ... nan contagious apparently , ... and so there's always the potential , of , .. when you bring a bird over , .. contamidate- -- Contaminating the poultry . ... Mm . .. Business . .. Okay , .. and so that is , .. th- background .. information , for the reason for quarantining . Um , .. with our nan other penguins , .. uh .. we brought them over , .. from Scotland , and , as it turned out , .. in a quarantine period that they had , .. that ... a vi- -- or I should say a fungus , okay this Aspergillosis fungus , ... had come to .. fruition , and we had lost , .. you know a good portion of penguins . .. So , Wow . okay , now it's time to .. consider replacing these penguins , .. how do we want to go about doing that . .. Well , ... really didn't want to go , .. through , transporting the birds . ... Didn't work last time , .. a .. potential for bringing over diseases , is obviously there , so , the thought was okay let's get some eggs . Um , .. Sea World San Diego ... has Gentus , and , ... apparently .. just not enough eggs to share . .. If they had them they would gladly . Same situation with the Edinburgh Zoo , they would gladly send us birds , ... but , .. they didn't feel that they had enough eggs , to send over . So , .. we really didn't want to go the bird route , and so , that left us the choice of going down to Antarctica , and collecting some peng- -- some penguin .. eggs ourselves . ... So they went to , ... and I don't know if this is pronounced correctly , Wiencke Island . Yeah , that's where ... a lot of seals are from as well . Hm . Okay . Mhm . Cool . Mhm ? Cool . ... That'll fit in with your class . I know .  Yeah  . Nicole is here . .. Hi , Nicole , Hi . Hey let me -- how you doing . Can I just interrupt for one minute , Oh okay . can I see your ID . .. Mine ? I don't think Darren put anything on it . None Mhm None . ... Right . Okay . .. Why don't you have a seat . Sure . ... .. Oh I'm tired . So , they went to .. Wiencke Island , where .. a lot of seals are from , .. and , Mhm .  . 2..  2..  -- 2.. collected eggs . .. Mhm . .. Okay , so , .. the process was , I'm just gonna finish up on my story , the process was , .. was they , um , ... they went to the nest , .. okay from .. our staff , it was Mark Ryan from marine mammals , and Mike Mulligan from fishes , .. and , .. frankly I- I'm not quite sure who the entourage of other people were . .. But , they went to the nest , .. and basically , ... waited for the penguin to stand up , ... and checked to see if there were two eggs there . ... Hm . .. Gentu .. penguins , and this isn- -- .. isn't TRUE of all penguins , often , ... when .. a ... penguin lays eggs , if it lays two , one is .. aller than the other . ... Gentus lay two equally sized eggs . ... Okay , ... um , Hm . .. the reason I mentioned that was , if one was .. aller , ... he would have went for the aller egg . .. Okay . .. Why . ... Because that would probably mean .. that , ... .. Female ? Do you remember reading , in the exhibit for the Rockhopper penguins , downstairs , .. they lay two different sized eggs . Mhm . ... Depending on the year , and depending on the conditions .. of light , ... um , if it's a bad year , or there's just not a lot of food resources , .. um , ... environmental conditions are rough , it's a stormy bad year , Mhm .  A penguin might .. lay two eggs , and at that point , ... I don't -- I don't really wanna use the word decide  , Mhm .  that's kind of anthropomorphic , .. but , .. ... somehow figure out , ... at this point I'm gonna kick out an egg None . Determine ? .. Ah . Mhm . I'm going to determine , through whatever , Mm . .. however it does determine to do so , Hm . will kick out an egg . ... ... Otherwise , .. it will .. brood the two eggs , .. and hatch em out . ... It's not uncommon that , at this point , ... they'll kick out the aller chick . .. Right . .. If at that point conditions .. don't seem to be sufficient to support raising two of em , ... it's kind of like , hey , why bother . .. Mhm . And kick out , .. one of -- .. One of the chicks . .. If it's a great year , on fat , there's food , di- it's a beautiful day None , It's called penguin euthanasia . ..   Okay ,   None   ..   None ..  They'll .. they'll , .. they'll try to raise both .  So , ..  ... I didn't catch that . What wa- -- It's called penguin euthanasia . Sh  Ch ..  None Yeah None .  ... Um , .. so , .. anyway . .. ... Apparently what th- .. what they -- .. Now at this point they wanted to see , okay , now , is there actually a fertile -- ... Is there a fertile ... chick , or developing chick inside . Mhm . And , .. apparently it was very very muddy , it was .. abnormally warm , and it was just a big mudbath out there , and they couldn't -- .. .. They couldn't .. clean off the mud enough , to .. be able to see inside . To see .. if , .. if it was viable . So , .. they took an egg from nests , that had two eggs . And I think this .. this report says , within thirty-one hours , .. the eggs were back here in Chicago . ... Wow . .. That's pretty neat . Oh . ... And then , they .. took them to an off-site incubation area , ... in Addison . Is anybody from Addison ? ... I don't know where Addison is .  I don't either s-  . It's a west suburb . ... West ? ... Yes . So they were out in the west suburbs . And incubated there .  ..  .. Mm . (SNIFF) .. And , .. apparently now they're about , six to seven weeks old ? .. Wow . When I was here two weeks ago , they were sixty days . T- ... s- two weeks ago it was sixty days ? I think , maybe it was four weeks ago . ... Okay . .. Yeah . I think , I think they're around six weeks old . .. Mm . Okay ? ... But when you see .. them , you'll see that they're ... just about as big as number ten . ... They're big . .. Nkay . Yeah . .. When I -- Yeah , when I was here they had , ... they were .. losing all of their .. hair . ... And they looked , ... the two oldest ones looked like Ten . .. Right . .. Right . So basically , what the process has been is , .. we brought them here as chicks , but they still had their downy feathers . .. Okay , so , as they lost their downy feathers , they became eligible to go out .. onto exhibit . And so what they did last time you guys were here , there was .. maybe ... ten . .. That were , .. you know , I say eligible , to be out on exhibit ,  and what they would do is , they would carry them in , ... let them hang out for about a half an hour , ... get acclimated to what was going on , and then take them off . .. And do this . Now they're out . ... Now they're , they are out on exhibit . All of them . ... Almost all of em . ... Two days ago there was twenty-five out on exhibit . So we have thirty chicks total . Right . Hm So , twenty-five plus are out on exhibit .  Okay . ... Um , ... thing of it is , is let's think a little bit about ... penguin natural history . Okay ? ... How , .. how long do penguins .. spend on land . ... Three months I think . ... What's your guess . ... Uh . Three or is it , three to six months ? ... Okay . .. ... Um , ... four ? Five ? ... Six . Six ? Okay ? Six months ? .. So , it's it's basically , Wow . it's an even even split ,  between , life out at sea and life on land . .. So the sequence of events .. is , .. they come on .. to shore , ... springtime , .. they hook up with their mate , .. they build a nest , .. they mate , .. they lay their eggs , they brood their eggs , they hatch their chicks , they brood their chicks , they feed their chicks , ... they molt , ... and then they're out to sea . ... So all of that has to happen , .. within that six-month period , that's a pretty busy bird , ..   so ,  None  None the penguins need to grow , the chicks , in order to be .. ready , to go out there , for six months out at sea , really need to be ... very well suited for that .  So they nee- need to be big , they need to be hefty , they need to have their adult feathers , ... so , Mm . ... between the time that they actually hatch out , ... and the time that they're ready to go out to sea , is just a couple of months . .. How long does it take for them .. to hatch . ...  Well the incubation period , Or um , .. to have experience . is anywhere , depends on the species , it's .. it's one month to two months . Oh okay . ... Okay , so , therefore , ... you know basically , ... between ... building a nest , and mating , and all of that other stuff , you know they , I would say that they have three months , ... to- .. to grow and get ready . ... Okay . .. So they're big . .. Now the funny thing is , is that , .. according to Mark Ryan , ... well , hmm .   Or just interesting . I guess  , Go watch them , um , Mhm . if you watch the trainers , they .. walk into the exhibit , and they start throwing penguins into the water ? ... And pushing them in , and they're .. all over the place , um ,  .. they try to get out , sometimes they make it , sometimes they fall back in , .. Gentus usually dive in ... head first , ... these guys are falling in ,  ..  jumping in , diving in , so their .. behaviors if you will are , are really interesting . ... Okay ? Mhm . It's just , it's just a lot of fun to watch them . .. Um , .. they're doing something different with these chicks than we've done with the other penguins , is that they're trying to feed them crill . ... Um , .. yesterday I think is th- is th- is when they tried it for the first time , and that crill , is about as big as , .. Mhm . you know from .. my joint , up to the top of my finger here , so .. it's very difficult for a person to hold a crill , ..  .. and drop it into a penguin's mouth . So , .. very good f- s- food source for them , that's what they would feed on in the wild , .. in addition to other things ,  so , what they're trying to do is , .. they're throwing the crill into the water , and seeing if the chicks'll go for it . .. So they tried it yesterday , and they had some mixed success , you know some animals were interested , others weren't . So , .. y- a- apparently they- they'll keep doing this . .. So . .. Did -- Were they weren't doing that when you were in there . No . No no no . 2.. Okay . ... When they were chicks , cause what is it -- How does a mother feed ... a penguin chick . ... Doesn't she bring food to it ? .. She regurgitates it . She regurgitates it . Oh . I sh- shouldn't say she , cause mother and father share , Both . Oh . share the duties , okay ? But yeah , they go out , they feed , ... and they regurgitate up the food , and that's how they feed the chicks . Mm . Actually other birds do that as well . A lot . Mhm . Don't they , a lot of birds do . Yeah . Yeah . A lot of birds do . That's right . ... They never really did any , well , we h- didn't regurgitate for them , but ,  they started them off with um .. strips of fish , and they actually .. dipped it in a vitamin and um ... pureed crill batter . Mm . ...  Dipped it in , and then gave it .. to the penguin chicks . So they've been on solid food , ... Hm . .. for quite some time , ... and now it's just interesting to see if they'll just go for the crill itself . Are they , I mean , are they being hesitant about it ? .. I didn't see it . .. Yesterday was the first time , Because , they did it at eleven thirty and four o'clock . ... Where the -- That's really interesting , because , I mean , going .. from being handfed . ... ... Right . ... Right . .. So I don't know . So I would say , if you've got the time , .. or if you wanna make the time to be down there at four thirty , ... hopefully they'll do it again today , and it'll be interesting to see , so . ... I'll find out from Mark . Um , you know what the response with that is . So four thirty's chick feeding ? ... Yes . ... Are there any particular trainers working with the penguins , uh , ... hm . ... Are all the trainers allowed to work with the penguins ? Yeah . Well basically here , um , all of the .. trainers work with all of the animals . .. So , they rotate them around , basically , ... Excuse me . ... So that the animals don't .. get ... attached to one person . Because if that person decides to leave , ... then , that could be detrimental to the animals . But , we do have a lead , .. a lead .. person for each animal .  Mark Ryan is lead penguins . Mhm . ... Meg is lead otter . .. Lisa Takaki was .. lead lag .  . Mhm . Greg is lead seal . So , .. .. Mark is basically calling the shots , ... for .. how the program's gonna be structured . So he's , he's the penguin trivia guy . ... So , .. it's a neat story , .. Mhm ? it's it's a very neat background story , .. and , I think , you know , .. for s- for some of us , underwater viewing gallery has not been your favorite place , so , this could , .. this .. .. could bring new light to the underwater viewing gallery , Could be a gift . and actually , .. just give a new focus on the penguins . We haven't done as much interpretation with the penguins , as we do with the other animals , so , you actually have some kinda .. neat things to interpret here . As far as what's going on . ... Some other things that you might see , the penguins .. segregate themselves . The species don't intermix . ... Okay , if you've noticed that before , Mm . the Rockhoppers pretty much station themselves in the center , .. the Magellanics used to be .. off to the right , (COUGH) ... and then , well number ten , .. could do whatever she wanted .  2..  The Gentu .  But , What's number ten . I k- --   I'm sorry , I I k- s- --  I k- I keep going , Number ten , what's number ten here  .    Kay , .. the .. the penguins are numbered . .. Oh okay . Each penguin is numbered .  And on , ... on 2... .. the arm , Wing .   .. okay , the .. the joint here , well , .. what do you call this . The wing . ... Humerus . ... Hm . ... At the humerus ? Hu- -- .. We would have  a tag , Mhm .  and they're colorcoded , so , if you were like to see , ... ... well how does it work . Give me a number . Well they wear colors . ... When I was there . .. Okay . ... They're colors but  , Just seven -- ... Did they move em to numbers ?  They were going to . ... What it is is that , ... green , let's say for example , green stands for one , black stands for two . ... That's number twelve . Is that how it works ? Yeah . .. Okay .  So , ... they number them , so that , when they're feeding them , and they're taking down the records of , okay number twelve ate five Columbia River elts , and two ,  .. Capelands . Mhm . .. They can keep a record of what the animal eats . ... Okay , so they don't have names , but , .. she , .. because sh- -- Because she's ... the lone feisty penguin , number ten has become kind of famous , in the penguin world downstairs . So , it it it's a female ,  th- the only female Gentu penguin , ... that we had prior to the chicks coming in . Okay . .. Okay , so , um , now you'll see that they're segregated , ... actually the Gentus have kind of broken up into clumps , and there's -- From what I saw yesterday , three different clumps , .. um , let's see -- Let's -- .. G- -- .. Let's interpret some of the behaviors we might see . Okay , what is , ... what is a penguin standing out with its arms like this . I shouldn't say arms . Its --  Wings .  Wings .  Its wings . Wings .   Right . Um , Perspiring ? ... actually cooling off , Cooling off . isn't it ? None Yeah None . ... Yeah . Mhm .  So right here , is where you don't , .. where the penguins don't have a a dense covering of feathers . ... So if they wanna cool off , they tend to do this . .. Okay if I was to see a penguin doing this , ... lifting one leg up , It's resting . .. Isn't it ? ... What else could it be . ... Sleeping ? .. No ? ... Balance ? I guess , It's balancing ,   it's doing thinking tricks .      Um ,  actually , it would be conserving heat . .. Okay ? Oh . Hm . So , .. the wings , ... and the f legs , feet , .. Mhm . ... there's no .. dense feather coverage on the , .. on the legs , so they might be conserving heat . ...  Okay , um , if , ..  I saw a penguin , .. .. sneezing . ..  What might be happening there . ... Allergic ? To food ?  Sick . 2 I've never heard a 3.. penguin sneezing but  ,       Cold ,  Okay .  It actually kind of sneezes , I know , could you hear it ?  ...  ... How can you tell from it , .. like shaking his head , You'll , or sneezing . you'll see him . You'll see him , just like 2.. what a person sneezing , Oh , okay . you can .. tell . Mhm . .. When they jerk their head like that . How was , how does a penguin .. get its fresh water . ... How does a penguin drink . ... Oh . ... I haven't studied penguins in a while ? Don , ... do you know ? No . .. Hmmm . From -- I thought a way w- -- ... Drank from pools . Just -- .. They'll drink salt water , Salt water . all- also , you know , like the dolphins , they actually metabolize the water , ... that's .. stored in .. in the fat of the fish that they eat . And that's how they get their water source . Mhm . But basically , you've gotta separate , the fresh water from the salt water , ... actually just have to separate out that salt . .. So they have a special s -- They have to do that ? So that's how they're do- -- Oh . That's what they're doing when they sneeze , is they're getting rid of .. the salt . Salt . Oh . That they have accumulated . They have a salt gland . ... In the beak . ... And that is what separates the salt out . Did you know that before . ... And to get rid of that salt they , Hmmm . Me neither . .. they sneeze . .. Yeah actually , Oh , I never even thought of that . I remember doing the penguin .. thing a year ago , but I don't remember that .. adaptation . No . ... Oh well . .. Um , ... we're gonna have to go up and do Q and A , in three minutes .  Just looking at the clock . Who's do- -- I'm facing the clock . Who's the diver .  .. I don't -- .. Oh , probably Bernie . ... Um , Do they have different divers , every , Mhm . time , Yeah , .. every day . ... Every day . Oh . So that would be excreting salt . Um , .. when I see a penguin .. .. picking its butt . .. What is it doing .   ... ... Preening ? Kinda like , picking at its feathers ? Preening . Preening . .. Okay . Preening . It's preening , what is it doing . What's at the base of the tail . ...  This is fun you guys .  Yeah , right .   It's at the -- It is fun . 3..      ..  ..  None What's at the base of the tail None . I wouldn't've even thought of these things ,  .. Well the anus is at the end of the tail . it's like , oh , didn't know they had meaning None . Pardon me ? Right ? The anus is at the end of the tail . That is , that is very TRUE , Right . but , But , let's say .. near .. the anus . .. What might be there . Why don't you answer this question . I got preening .    4.. Ah . It's okay . 3..  It's -- It's the preening gland .  6.. Yeah . Oh , okay . Okay , so it's a gland , ... that ... stores oil , so what a penguin will do , is it'll go back , it'll squeeze the gland , (COUGH) it'll get some oil on its beak , and then , .. it's rubbing .. that .. waterproofing ,  .. So it can keep itself waterproof , right . Mm . waterproofing , Mhm . Oh . .. all over its feathers . Hm . Mhm . ... Preening , also consists of , .. working .. an air layer , ... at the base of the feathers , ... because air .. is a better insulator .. than water . If there was water touching the skin , Hm . .. water is like a vacuum cleaner . It is just gonna suck the heat away , Mhm . so by having the air there , it's a better insulator . .. So when I see a penguin dive into the water , and I see all of these little air bubbles coming out , .. what am I seeing . .. The air is r- -- .. Is , ... Escaping from the feathers . escaping . .. Right . Is compressed out , From the -- .. so the penguin comes up on land , and let's start again . Mhm . .. And will start preening , working that air layer in , getting some oil ,  .. spreading it out , None How often do the -- Mm . How d- often does the bird molt .   Once a year ? Once a year . Okay . .. Some species'll .. molt .. twice . None Twice .  But basically , if you think about it , .. you know , a year , of picking at the feathers , the feathers are gonna wear out . Mhm .  So the last thing that a penguin does , before it goes out to sea , ... is , Shed its , .. yeah . Okay . It ... does a clean sweep . .. Mhm . And , molts all of its feathers off . ... And then gets the new feathers on . ... .. Okay . ..  So , other than that , um , .. really the only training ? .. That they do .. with the penguins ? You know , we train all kinds of behaviors , with the other animals . .. The- the- the- the training that they do with the penguins , is basically , that they have feeding stations for them . Hm . .. Uh Rockhoppers' is here , uh Gentus' is here , Magellanics' is here , and you are not gonna get a fish , ... unless you come to your feeding station . .. Do they pretty much know that by now ? .. Have they pretty much adapted to that ? ... ... They were still in the room . ... Okay . When , when I was here . And , they were , .. they were pretty random ... about it , .. because Mark would .. take , .. you know a bucket over here , Right . And that was with the chicks . and then , whoever , yeah . Okay . .. With .. the , ... yeah , ... I mean , the ones that were .. in there , The adult penguins . they , yeah , the adult ones were fine about it , Mhm . you know , someone set up over here , and someone over here , and they ... pretty much went , ... where they were supposed to . So they knew , to go to station one , .. Yeah . Versus station two . Right . Yeah . ... Okay . So , ... I guess .  Not I'm not -- .. I'm not sure , but , ... it's just kind of interesting , because , ... other facilities , as far as I'm aware , it's like with the sea otters as well , you know , the training that they do with these animals is pretty minimal . With the sea otters , they're pretty -- .. They can be aggressive , they have .. big teeth . People have historically done more training , with cetaceans , than they have .. with other animals , and we , we really do some pretty unique training here , ... with our penguins , with our sea otters , and with our seals . Mhm . So . ... It's kinda neat stuff . ... Cool .  ... Anything else ? About penguins , that we should discuss ? ... For you guys , the key to the penguin .. cart , .. if you d- -- Well , I don't , .. The puffin cart ? None Are -- Yeah the -- Puffin cart ? Mhm . Is ... on , is behind the tide pool . On one of re- the reserve tanks . So if you choose to pick a specimen , ... you don't have to bring the whole cart out . If you wanna grab a specimen , Hm . and bring it out to the exhibit , that's fine . But ,  I suggest that .. you .. check it out .. today , anyway , um , ... there's just -- ... There's some neat things to interpret . So .  .. Check it out . You've got .. underwater viewing . Yeah . ... At three . Check it out . So if there's a time , .. you know for Lori to go do it , Well I'll probably go between coastal , .. I'll probably meander coastal downstairs .  Okay . Cause there's a presentation ... close to four thirty . Okay . ... Great , Oh wait . ... Never mind . .. I'll do it then . ... When there's a presentation at three . ... Perfect . .. Mhm . .. So that is penguin stuff . Um , I hate to say it , but , ... can you guys go do Q and A , or who -- Or Lori are you doing Q and A ? No , I don't think anyone signed up for Q and A . Nobody signed up for Q and A . 2..   Nobody's gonna do Q and A ?   .. I should've cancelled it then . .. Guys why won't somebody do Q and A None . Well , both of us . Do it together . You wanna do it ? Yeah , cause I can't remember the questions . .. Do it together . You have to remind me the question . I gotta be down at the tide pool at two thirty . Alright . That's okay . Okay . .. Okay . We'll do Q and A . And if it's -- Thanks guys . .. Uh what time is .. Q and A , two .. twenty , Now . ... And , Right now . tell me when I can get checked out on seals . None Two fifteen None . Okay . I'll find you . Today . Where's the um , I will find you . 2.. I don't wanna do it in two weeks , I'll forget . where's the --  No I won't , I promise . ... Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen , We'd like to welcome you to the Kentucky Horse Park , and to the Hall of Champions presentation . We have four geldings and one stallion that we'll present for you this afternoon , and as we bring them out , we'll give you the history on each one , and please feel free to take all the pictures that you want , and to ask questions . ... Our first horse here today at the Hall of Champions , is our only thoroughbred stallion . .. This is Bold Forbes . .. Bold Forbes is a dark bay or brown stallion , and he was foaled in nineteen seventythree . He is by the stallion Irish Castle , and out of the unraced mare Comely Nell . He was bred by Lee Eaton , and Red Bull Stables . This grandson of Bold Ruler was entered into a sale in July of nineteen seventyfour . .. Mister Estaban Tizol , a banker and real estate developer from Puerto Rico , liked Bold Forbes' pedigree . And he liked this horse so much , that he decided he was going to buy him , no matter what the cost . .. The cost ended up being fifteen-thousand two-hundred dollars , and Bold Forbes was then shipped to El Commandante racetrack in San Juan Puerto Rico . ... In Bold Forbes' very first start in Puerto Rico as a twoyearold , he went off at odds of thirty-five to one , .. and he won that race by seventeen lengths . ... He was entered into four more races , .. he won them all , and in doing so , he was named champion two-year-old in Puerto Rico . ... Well El Commandante is the only racetrack in Puerto Rico , so it didn't take Bold Forbes too long to run out of competition . ... So in the summer of nineteen seventyfive , he was shipped to New York , to his new trainer Laz Barrera . ... In New York he won the Freemont Stakes , and the Saratoga Special , before he injured his shins , and was given the rest of the year off . ... Well all of Bold Forbes's races up to this point had been sprints , or six furlong races . The Kentucky Derby is a much longer race , at a mile and a quarter . ... So as a threeyearold , Forbes wasn't given much of a chance at all in the Kentucky Derby . ... But his trainer had more confidence in him than that , and with Angel Cordero junior in the saddle , Bold Forbes won the Kentucky Derby , at odds of seventeen to one , ... one length in front of the leader , .. Honest Pleasure . ... The Preakness however was a disappointment for Bold Forbes . He cut his left hind heel during the race , but he still managed to run third . ... But when the Belmont rolled around , he had that all healed up , and he won the Belmont stakes by a neck . ... In October , Forbes was entered into the Vosburgh Handicap , and again he severely bruised his right hind foot . Again he ran a very game third , but after this race , he was considered too valuable a breeding stallion to risk any more injury . So he was retired to stud from the track . ... Bold Forbes was syndicated to stud for a hundred and thirty thousand dollars per share , and he stood his entire career at Arthur Hancock Stone Farm . ... As a stallion , Bold Forbes produced a champion filly Tiffany Lass , a winner of over half a million dollars , Bold Apparel , a champion filly in Italy , Air Forbes One , and over two-hundred other winners . .. Bold Forbes is a winner of over half a million dollars , in just two years on the racetrack . He was in eighteen races , and had thirteen wins , and was never worse than third . ... He was retired from stud duty in the spring of nineteen ninetyone . .. He is twenty-one years old , and stands fifteen point three hands tall . .. Ladies and gentlemen , the nineteen seventy-six Kentucky Derby winner , .. Bold Forbes . .. APPLAUSE .. Does anyone have any questions , while we're waiting for the next horse to come out . ... Questions ? ... Okay , while we're waiting , I'll just call everyone's attention to this horse , I don't know if everyone can see him , over here in this paddock on the right , this is Sergeant Pepper Feature , and , he's usually in our show , but , because Bold Forbes is up here today , he -- We kicked him out . We have six horses that belong to the Hall of Champions , and only five stalls . So we could only have five at a time in the show .  Um , Sergeant Pepper was the nineteen eighty-two world champion racing quarter horse , and , at the time of his retirement , he was the eighth richest quarter horse in history , and he had earnings of over nine-hundred thousand dollars . ... So , on your way out .. today , you might wanna just take a look over there , and say hi to Sergeant Pepper . . And there's Bold Forbes looking out the window . If anybody can see him , he's right there , watching the show  . . Our next horse is the first horse to retire here to the Hall of Champions , that is not a racehorse . ... This is Imperator . And he is a five-gaited American Saddlebred showhorse . ... Perry , as he is commonly called , is by the sire Supreme Sultan , who is buried in front of the saddlehorse museum here at the Horse Park . .. He is out of the dam Empress Wing , .. and she is by the great sire Wing Commander . Only Wing Commander holds more world grand championships than Imperator . .. Perry was born in Wilmette Illinois , and he was purchased there as a twoyearold , by his owner , Doctor Geraldine Meanor , and then sent to his trainer , Don Harris , of Simpsonville Kentucky . .. Now Perry and Mister Harris had a very special bond that they shared . They both had the same birthday . And as the years went past , and Imperator's popularity increased , Mister Harris didn't get too upset when Perry received more birthday cards and presents than he did . ... Being five-gaited means that Perry performs the three natural gaits , .. the walk trot and canter , plus two manmade gaits , the slow gait and the rack . ... The only difference in these gaits are the speed at which they're performed . ... Perry's greatest accomplishment was winning the five-gaited world grand championship four times . And he has also been reserve world champion five times . ... He was shown eighty-five times , at forty-four shows around the country . He has sixty-eight blue ribbons , thirteen seconds , and very rarely was he ever worse than third . ... Now the first time Perry was shown , he was very wild and inexperienced , and he stepped on just about every foot in the show ring . And he even chased the judges out of the ring on several occasions . ... But the second time he was shown , he had improved so much , the judges said he would have won if he'd been lying on his back , .. with all four feet stuck up in the air . ... Perry's most beautiful characteristic during his show career was his tail . .. At the highlight of his career , .. Perry's tail was fourteen feet long , and could be wrapped completely around his body . ... If you wanted to take a picture of all of Perry , you had to take two pictures to include all of his tail . .. When Perry was retired , Mister Harris cut his tail , to make it easier to care for , and he was able to make three FALSE tails from the hair he had taken from Perry's tail . .. Well Perry had been retired here for about two years , but had never had a formal retirement . So in August of nineteen ninetyone , Perry was formally retired at the world championship horse show in Louisville Kentucky . .. That night , Imperator and his trainer , Mister Don Harris , stepped into the ring , one last time together , and were both named the American Saddlebred horse and trainer for the decade of the nineteeneighties . ... Perry is now twenty years old , and stands fifteen point three hands tall . Ladies and gentlemen , the four-time world grand champion , .. Imperator . .. APPLAUSE .. Does anyone have any questions , while we're -- Yes . ... What's the average age that a horse lives to . A good average is about twentyeight , if they're well taken care of . Um , a lotta horses will live into their thirties . ... A- a good way to compare horse ages to humans , is to multiply by three . ... And -- Except , I think the oldest liv- -- Oh , oldest horse on record , I think in the Guinness Book of World Records , was sixty-two  . ... So don't multiply that .. that one by three . That would be what , a hundred and eighty-six .. or something  . .. Are there any other questions ? ... No ? ... If anyone's interested in seeing what Perry looked like , when he had his fourteen-foot tail , um , when you come into the visitor center , I don't know if- if .. anybody noticed this , there's a TV monitor right after you -- .. Where you buy your tickets when you come in , and you look up , and there's a -- An ongoing Hall of Champions presentation on this TV monitor up there , and uh , there's a little clip of Imperator on there , and I think he's slowgaiting , .. which was his most .. beautiful gait , .. um , and you can see his fourteen-foot tail up there , and that was- -- It was really beautiful . .. . Do you have a question ? ... Back there ? ... He wants to know how you say hi to a horse . ... Um , ... just say hi  . .. You can just say hi , and they- -- And you can say their name , .. cause they know their names . ... So if you wanted to say hi to Imperator , just -- .. And he goes by Perry , so if you just come up to him and say hi Perry , he'll know you're talking to him . ... Our next horse is one of our two thoroughbred geldings here at the Hall of Champions , this is Forego . ... Forego is by the Argentine stallion Forli , .. and he is out of the champion race mare Lady Golconda . ... He was bred and raised at Claiborne Farm in Paris Kentucky . .. Due to Forego's large size , he was not raced as a twoyearold , because his owners thought they would give him more time to mature . ... He started his racing career as a threeyearold . And he ran well enough to be entered in the nineteen seventy-three Kentucky Derby . ... Well you may recall that this was the year that a horse named Secretariat won the Kentucky Derby , on his way to sweeping the Triple Crown . ... Well Forego wasn't as successful as Secretariat that day , But he did run a fine race . ... He was involved in a bumping incident , as the horses left the starting gate . He recovered from that , .. but he and another horse , Our Native , bumped through the entire stretch , and both horses ended in a photo finish for third . ... After the steward's inquiry , Forego had to settle for fourth , .. because the steward said the bumping was all his fault . ... The older Forego got , the better he got , and he became one of the greatest handicap horses to ever race . He has also been voted one of the top ten racehorses of the century . ... Being a handicap horse means that Forego ha- -- Forego had to carry a lot of extra weight , over whatever distance he was asked to run , in order to give the other horses more of a chance . ... He was in thirty-four handicap events , and thirty times , he was the high-weighted horse . ... The most weight Forego ever had to carry to victory , was a hundred and thirty-seven pounds . And that was in the nineteen seventy-six Marlboro Cup . ... Well before the race it had rained , and the track was sloppy , and Forego was always a little wimpy about getting his feet wet . ... So as the field turned for home , it looked just as if he was hopelessly beaten , some ten lengths behind the leader Honest Pleasure . ... Honest Pleasure had been the Kentucky Derby favorite that year , ... He was three years younger than Forego , and was carrying almost twenty pounds less in weight . ... But determined to win , Forego made up that last quarter mile , in twenty-two seconds flat , and he beat Honest Pleasure at the wire . ... The jockey that rode Forego , the great Willy Shoemaker , said there wasn't a horse alive , that could've beaten Forego on that day . ... Forego was named horse of the year , three consecutive years , in nineteen seventy-four seventy-five and seventysix . And he has also been champion sprinter , as well as champion handicap horse . ... An Eclipse Award is the highest honor a thoroughbred can receive . And Forego holds eight Eclipse Awards , which is more than any other horse . ... Forego retired in nineteen seventyeight , with earnings of over one point nine million dollars , which made him the second richest thoroughbred in history at that time , behind Kelso . ... He was inducted into racing's hall of fame in nineteen seventynine . ... Forego is one of our senior citizens here at the Hall of Champions , he is twenty-four years old , and stands a very impressive seventeen point one hands tall . ... Ladies and gentlemen , the great handicap horse , ... Forego . ... APPLAUSE ... Does anyone have any questions ? ... Questions ? . Okay , Oh . Okay , I don't have my glasses on , I couldn't see you  . What is the average weight for a horse . ... Um it varies , um , ... like .. probably , ... let's see , Forego probably weighs around t , ... oh about twelve hundred , ... maybe twelve fifty , some of the draft horses weigh over a ton , ... in the draft horse barn , some of the -- The Belgians are the biggest horses . ... The- the Shires are the tallest , but the Belgians are the heaviest . And -- .. Have you been to the draft barn yet ? ... Did you see Roy and Captain , ... the two big Belgians , ... They weigh , .. they both weigh over two th- -- I th- -- I know .. Roy does . I'm not sure about Captain , but Roy weighs over two thousand pounds . ... Yes . .. Isn't Secretariat , ... didn't he die , and wasn't he buried on this property somewhere . Uh , .. uh he's buried at Claiborne Farm . Claiborne . Mhm . ... How did he die . ... Pardon ? .. How did he die . .. He was put down , he had laminitis , .. which is a disease of the h- -- Of the hoof , ... and and they put him down . ... Our next horse to come out today , is our other thoroughbred gelding to be retired here , and you'll see that he's a lot aller than Forego . ... This is John Henry . ... John Henry is the horse that comes from very humble beginnings . He is by the stallion Old Bob Bowers , who was not much of a racehorse or a stallion either . .. And he is out of the brood mare Once Double , who outside of John Henry , had very little success as a brood mare . ... John was born on March ninth nineteen seventyfive , at Golden Chance Farm in Paris Kentucky . .. The farm kept John until nineteen seventysix , when he was consigned to the Keenenland January Mixed Sale . .. Now this sale is not a very good time to sell a horse , it's usually when people try to sell the horses they don't think are worth feeding through the winter . ... So because of his all size , his lack of pedigree , but most of all , his very nasty disposition , John brought only eleven hundred dollars . ... And from the time of this first sale , until May nineteen seventyeight , John was sold , over half a dozen times , because nobody wanted him , and nobody could get along with him . ... But in May of nineteen seventyeight , a New York businesan , Sam Rubin , decided it would be fun to own a racehorse . .. Well Mister Rubin didn't know anything about horses , and the only thing he knew about racing , is where the valet parking was . ... So he bought John Henry , over the telephone , sight unseen , for twenty-five thousand dollars . .. John then went to New York , to his first trainer Bobby Donato . .. In his very first New York start , he won a twenty-five thousand dollar claiming race , over the dirt , by one and a half lengths . .. His next race was on turf , which John preferred to run on , and again he won , but this time by fourteen lengths . ... Well a group of horsemen who knew more about racing than Mister Rubin did , advised him to send John west , .. where the turf racing was more lucrative , more competitive , and run all year long . ... So in late nineteen seventynine , John headed west , to his new trainer , .. Ronald McAnally . ... In nineteen eighty , John won over nine-hundred thousand dollars . .. In nineteen eightyone , John won the very first Arlington Million , over one point seven million dollars , and was voted horse of the year . .. In nineteen eightytwo , and nineteen eightythree , John had some injuries , and only won four races , but they mounted up to one point two million dollars . ... And when Mister McAnally wanted to bring John Henry back as a nineyearold , folks were pretty skeptical about his chances of being competitive at this age . ... Well John did lose his first race that year , but he went on to have his best year ever on the racetrack . ... He won six graded stakes , including a repeat victory in the Arlington Million , over two point three million dollars , and again was voted horse of the year . ... When John was retired in nineteen eightyfour , he was the world's richest thoroughbred in history . With earnings over six point five million dollars . ... Since then Alisheba has beat his record , but John is still the richest gelding . ... John holds seven Eclipse Awards , which is second only to Forego's eight , and was inducted into the racing hall of fame in nineteen ninety . ... John was also named the thoroughbred horse of the decade , for the nineteen eighties . ... John has been retired here for eight years now . He is nineteen years old , and stands a very all , fifteen point one hands tall . .. Ladies and gentlemen , the great great .. John Henry . .. APPLAUSE ... Does anyone have any questions ? ... Yes . .. The horses that retire here , how much exercise , and what kind of   . Okay . .. These horses are .. are not ridden anymore , um , they're just ,  l- like you said , they're retired , they each have their own paddock , except for Sergeant Pepper and Imperator , they -- We turn them out together , because they're friends , and mostly they just hang out in their paddock , and they graze and , they exercise themselves , they run around a lot , and keep themselves in shape , and , that's about all they do . They get , they get lots of treats , and lots of love and , .. s- we think they're happy . .. But , they still run around , um , just .. like young horses , sometimes John will get out there and run around , he'll rear up on his hind legs , like .. Silver , you know and do  -- And uh it's real cute , uh Forego'll run around , Willie , .. and his little goat will get out there and , and run and , .. Imperator usually likes to trot . He doesn't gallop a lot , but he trots around like he did when he was showing and , it's -- .. They're real cute . ... There any other questions ? ... Yes . ... What -- .. Uh , .. the goat .. in with the horse . Are they just .. good friends ? Uhuh . .. That's his little buddy  . ... They're just friends . He- -- Willie doesn't really like other horses very well . .. And and he likes people , but he's not as affectionate as maybe Perry , or .. Sergeant Pepper so , we don't want him to get lonely , and that's his  , ..  that's his little friend  . ...  ..  ... Originally they had got the goat for John Henry , when he first came to live here , eight years ago , and they put the goat in the stall with him , he kicked it back out ,  and um ,  so Willie adopted it .  And that .. original goat died about a year ago , and Willie was real sad and depressed , so they got him a new one . ... Our last horse to come out today , is our standardbred representative , Rambling Willie . .. A standardbred races at a trot or a pace , and they pull a sulky with a driver . ... Willie is a pacer . ... Willie was born in Monroeville Indiana , and he began his racing career as a toyearold , for his owner Raymond Gibson . He had four starts with two seconds and two thirds , so he did show some promise , but Mister Gibson decided to sell Willie as a threeyearold . ... Willie was sold to a hall of fame trainer and driver , Mister Robert Farrington , for fifteen thousand dollars . But not long after he bought him , Mister Farrington decided he'd spent too much money on this horse , so he called a friend of his from Cincinnati Ohio , Mister Paul Sebert , and he tried to talk Mister Sebert into buying a half interest in Willie . ... Well Mister Sebert had owned horses before , and his luck had been pretty bad . .. The first horse he owned died , before it made it to the racetrack , and the second horse he owned made it to the races , and she ran and ran , but just couldn't win anything , so he sold her . .. And after he sold her , she went on to win her next four starts in a row for her new owner . ... Well Mister Sebert did buy a half interest in Willie though , and things didn't start off so well there either . ... Willie was being raced at county fairs , in Ohio and Indiana , and was being beaten on a regular basis . ... Well around this time Mister Farrington's wife Vivian was having a birthday , and he was trying to decide what to get her . .. So Mister Farrington decided that a good present for Vivian , would be the other half of Willie . ... Well Vivian was a very religious person , and her father at that time was the minister of a nearby church . .. So Vivian decided , that if Willie ever had any success at the racetrack , she would donate ten percent , of her half of Willie's earnings , to her father's church . ... And that's when Willie's racing career took off . Because of his success , and his ties to the church , .. there was a book written about Willie , titled , Rambling Willie , The Horse That God Loved . .. In order to promote his book , .. Willie would hold autograph sessions . .. One day when Willie was in New York , he had an autograph session at Macy's department store . And he was such a hit there , that Macy's gave him his very own charge card . ((LAUGHTER)  Well Willie is without a doubt one of the toughest and most durable horses to ever race . He raced from the age of two to thirteen . .. He had an incredible three-hundred and five starts . He won a hundred and twenty-eight times , sixty-nine times he finished second , .. and seventy-nine times he paced the mile , in two minutes or less , which is a record Willie still holds today . ... When he retired , he was the richest standardbred in history , with earnings over two million dollars . ... Willie is our other senior citizen here at the Hall of Champions , he is twenty-four years old , and stands fifteen point two hands tall . Ladies and gentlemen , the horse that God loved , .. Rambling Willie . APPLAUSE .. Now I'll just let everybody know , that Willie's book is for sale here at the Horse Park gift shop . ... And we'd like to thank everyone , for coming to the Horse Park , and to the Hall of Champions presentation , we hope you've had a good day , and if you have any questions , feel free to ask us on your way out . .. Thank you very much . ... APPLAUSE .. Well let's .. kind of figure out a classic , um , nan diet , uh , .. quota , for you . And , let me get a piece of paper , so that we can write that .. down , ((DESK_DRAWER) (SNIFF) ... The way we do this , Yeah . ... is first of all , we make a , a guesstimate , .. of how many calories , .. typically , that you would need . D- we- we didn't do this last time did we . Hmm . Okay . Alright . Yeah , I think .. we were gonna wait , until we , .. cause you were gonna change some things maybe , after you saw Doris . So , first of all we make a good guesstimate . Of how many calories you need . And that's always a tough one . Um , Mhm . .. most women , unless you work out a lot . .. You probably aren't burning much more  than like eighteen hundred ,  to maybe .. two thousand calories . Mhm .  So , what we can do , um , .. I would say , I'm gonna go ahead and make it out about eighteen hundred . .. Just because , uh , you're at a good weight , you're about five five , ..  um , ... ... I think that would be a prudent place to , .. to start out from . .. I know I won't uh , .. cause you to gain weight , and , .. you probably won't lose any either . But uh ,    Okay . So we're gonna take eighteen hundred calories , (SNIFF) Uh h- -- How um , .. how many calories do you think I'm eating now , or can you even tell that ,   from looking ? I could do a calorie count , um , on that , .. but I'd actually need more .. amounts .  Although , you wouldn't be able to tell , because , there's no , I don't write down , like the fats , and things like that . .. Well , if , .. if you gave me real specific amounts . Like , I had , you know , one quarter cup of soy milk , half a cup of cereal , Yeah . then I could -- Oh , okay- -- 2.. I could count your calories , 2.. I see . (SNIFF) and and figure that out . And run it through the computer . .. And get a printout . Mm . Hm . Of .. your nutrient ratio , and everything . .. Wow . For the day . In fact if you wanna do that , I'd be glad to run it for you , But you'd have to take one day . ... Mhm . And really , And write everything down . Yeah . .. be ,  .. like , .. precise . Okay .  Um , okay . So eighteen hundred calories , times , .. point four , .. that's gonna be forty calories , .. or excuse me . Um forty percent of your calories , coming from carbo .. hydrate . And that's Doris's standard protocol really . Mm . .. Okay times point four , .. gives us seven hundred and twenty ... carbohydrate .. calories .  Yeah . .. Then we divide that .. by four .  .. Calories per gram . ... You've --  I know you've seen this before . Which gives us a quota , of a hundred and eighty .. grams of carbohydrate .. per day . ... Actually I should've done that . Mm . ..  Okay . Then we have to distribute it . Wow . .. That's low .    Yeah . That's not that much  . It is .  2..  Then we have to distribute that , into a , an ideal ratio . Now you always do have breakfast . Really . Unless you're running , a bit on the higher side . Really high . Yeah . ... And you always have some kinda lunch pretty much , .. and you always ... have some kind of dinner . Well yeah . ... Basically .  ..    .. Now the mid-morning snack , the snacks are hit and miss . That's where , we maybe , .. would h- .. have to , .. to look at things . A little bit more closely . But usually , ... lunch and dinner are your main .. meals . And we would give you about , .. a thirty percent quota , .. at both lunch .. and dinner , ... which is , ... about fifty .. four .. grams , ... at each of those places . ... Hm . Would be sort of your .. ballpark ... quota . And , .. it's not outlandish . Like here .. you were sixtyfour , .. well , a little bit higher . .. Um , ... Mm . ... Here , well you were about uh forty fiftynine , sixtyfour . So sixtyfour , fifty , that was seventyfour . So it's ... a little bit higher . Is what you're used to doing . Mhm . And , um , ..   .. Yes . Yeah nan , I remember . Like  ,  a long long time ago . Let's see uh , .. it was ,  I guess forty , maybe forty forty-five seventy . .. Or something .  Okay . That's how they had it divided up .  Okay . 2.. I think . Although , that's m- .. more . .. Right ? .. Let's see . ... Tsounds pretty high . That's -- .. Yeah . Yeah . That's , what . A total of a hundred and -- It might've been based , either on a higher .. calorie level , (SNIFF) .. or , a higher .. percent , of your calories coming from carbos . Mhm . .. Mhm . Like if this were fifty percent ? Mhm .  Which is ... probably more realistic , for how you eat . Mhm . Being a vegetarian , .. you eat more -- And we can change it .. up . But we'll use this as a base . And then we wanna compare it , Mhm . .. to what you typically do , .. and , .. the thing is if you started doing this right now , you'd have low blood sugars . .. Right .  Cause you've already adjusted your insulin , Yeah . .. to another .. level . Mhm .   But I think what you could learn from this , is that , um , ... at least , if you sort of chose a standard  place for a while ? Mhm . Until you got things a little more stabilized , .. it might be easier , .. to do your insulin . Mhm . Mhm .  And then , um , once you , y- are a little more comfortable with that , then you can start doing this flux with , Right . adding the unit for another ten grams . Say if you usually have sixtyfour , and you find , you know , ex units of insulin works for that , Mhm . .. well , .. then you can- jockey it from there . Now at breakfast , .. we often keep that down around twelve , because , Twelve ? Wow . Uh , percent . Uh , Oh ,   .. point one two .. times , I thought you meant grams  . I was gonna say h , where do you find food , that's that low  . Well ,     some people actually  end up  having to do that . That's only about twenty grams . Zero , or something (SNIFF) ? Because of that dawn phenomenon . Mm . ... Mm .  So , that's not much , at all . Then , Yeah , like even an English muffin is too much . .. Unhunh . .. Unhunh . Even oatmeal . .. It's it's really difficult . you can either have , either or , sort of a thing . Let's see , sixty seventytwo , ... okay . So that gives us a twentyeight , to distribute .. throughout .. the rest of the day . And , um , .. making a decision of how to do that , .. really involves .. your insulins . Now , .. in the morning , .. you've got a good amount . Of regular insulin that you take ? Mhm . So I would wanna put a little bit higher percentage , for your snack there ? Like , Mhm . I would say maybe even .. ten percent here ? ... Um ,    See , I hate that snack . Having to eat snacks . Oh . I just don't have time .  You know . .. The only  trouble with that is , None  .. at breakfast , .. you , .. just won't have .. your insulins there for you , to eat the big carbo breakfast , typically . Mm .  Unless , you .. run high , .. after breakfast . And then it comes down , when the insulins finally do get working . Mhm .  But then you're running high . .. Mhm . And that's , ... you know , that's the only way to protect yourself , Right . is yeah , you eat a bunch of carbo , you take a bunch of insulin ,  you run high for an hour and a half , Right . and then all of a sudden it comes skyrocketing down . Mhm .  When all the insulins get on board None . Mhm . So , um , .. Right . Anyway . Uh , point one , ... okay , that's just gonna be eighteen , .. .. I wonder how -- roughly there , ..  How does Doris do that though . Because she like , I don't think she eats lunch , or anything . .. I mean ,   she just like , has this really minimal ... dose of NPH , .. I think .   You'd have to ask her .  None That's what uh None , I don't know . That's what I suspect .      ..         I don't know the trade secrets there  .  Um ,  ... but uh , h- nan you know I think , ... probably , .. um , .. keeping the carbos .. a little on the lower side , enable -- .. Of course then you'd need less insulin , which makes life easier . Mhm . .. Mhm . It does make it easier , if you do eat less carbo . Cause you don't have to take these big amounts , and then wonder what they're gonna do and when . Mhm .  Um , .. this actually , sometimes makes it more complicated . ... Now , mid afternoon . you are taking a touch of regular at lunch , ... but you don't really ... eat much of a snack . ... Usually . ... After lunch . Cause you have a late lunch , ... might have some Cheetos there I see . Mhm . ... Oh , that was just cause I was like , Um , ... couldn't eat dinner  . Cashews . Hm .  Um ,    I had to go to something , like right at , at six o'clock , or seven o'clock , or something . So that really may be one ,  .. where , it's sort of debatable . .. You know , maybe at the most you'd have five percent there . ... Um , and I'm just sort of guessing , .. as a place to start , ... uh why'd I do that ? I knew what it was ? ... And that's just .. hardly anything . That's a f- -- Some , a few nuts . Really . And that's about it or , .. um , ... then later on , you do sometimes eat after dinner . Cause you're .. kind of a nightowl , .. and um ,  ... let's see this'll go twentytwo , .. plus , ... uh , so we're looking at , about , roughly , ... thirteen fifteen percent there , ... so , ... okay so , approximately well s , ... essentially like breakfast . ... ... So , those would just be places .. to start from . .. But I think , um , .. what's even more important , Okay . .. is , you've gotta tailor it , to what your insulin is . And use these as a jumping off place . You know , if you say , well this is .. ridiculous , I always have .. a seventy carbo dinner , Mhm . well , .. so what . .. You know , there's nothing wrong with that , it just .. means , you slightly .. adjust .. that insulin . .. Same thing if you don't like snacks , .. what are you gonna do .. to compensate , Mhm . .. for the fact , that , .. there's .. there's a lotta insulin there maybe . .. And um , Mhm . .. how are you gonna get around that . Um , ... but that's the sole purpose of snacks , is to really prevent , lows from happening , .. and to .. counteract , um , .. the insulin .. time .. actions . Um , .. So  . Hm . M- -- ..  Oh -- Maybe we should compare -- .. None -- .. Go ahead .   Oh , I just had one question , so for example , Unhunh ? say I .. didn't eat lunch ? ... Then what would happen . .. Like , .. then I could not take .. the insulin there . ... .. And then , ... Well , But then , I don't know , you probably would need to eat .. a little something , I wonder . I would get high then maybe , hunh ?   because , of your NPH .. peaking , Mhm . .. Mhm . .. although , you don't take ... a lot of NPH . ... So , .. In the morning yeah . .. It may be debatable , if you really need to have something , .. later in the af , uh or , b- .. to get you into dinner , okay . .. Um , ... Hmm . ... You know , you might have to eat sort of an afternoon snack , if you don't . Mhm . ... Um , or , yeah . Take , look at , look at the NPH that you're taking , and , y- Doris could .. help you with that . Did she give you a scale for a w- no lunch , .. lunch .. scale .  A w- while ago , but um , ... it changed after that . .. See this was the original thing . .. That I had . .. She said , but -- ... Okay , this was , .. hm . .. This was a while ago . See , ... three twenty-four ninetyfour . So , um , ... like , for example , she had these two .. things , so if I .. was gonna eat , .. like say I , .. I decided ok , in the morning . I was gonna eat lunch ? Then , .. I would .. take four , ... units of NPH and then , .. supplement it , ... with the regular , but if I knew , .. like say in the morning ? .. That I wasn't gonna eat lunch ? ... Then , Hm . she said take .. -- But this doesn't make any sense . ... To me . Take six NPH , cause I would be low , with this then , definitely . .. .. You know . Yeah , In in the .. afternoon . hunh . .. Okay . Yeah nan . I think this was kinda guessing , Well , too . Cause , it was before , Hm . .. I had really -- Yeah . ... Definitely , um , .. you know , check with her , .. on your insulins . Cause , you know , she , is the only one that can really ... clarify them . Um , .. you know , just , .. it's tough . To ,  to do the jockeying of of the food , and the insulin . It really , um , .. .. nan Mm . It it just , it makes it really , um , .. a a challenge there to ,  Well , this is where I got the idea that she d- -- Probably doesn't eat lunch . Well , I don't know how she would have time , anyway . Every time you see her , it's like  ,  you know five minutes here , five minutes there , but um , then , .. also , just like um , ... I don't know . She sort of , like , knew what I meant , when I was saying , Unhunh . .. Unhunh . oh , it's such a pain to have to 2 stop and eat lunch . Mhm . You know  .  .. And , so , um , ... that's where I got that idea . .. But , Mm . Mhm . ... Well , it's , .. -- .. Yeah . Let's see . And so .. four of N , .. six of N , ... and then zero regular there . ... .. Yeah . Hm . That's where just monitoring , monitoring , monitoring . Um , Mhm . lets you know , if if it's gonna work for you , or not . If it's too strong , or , not strong enough . Mhm . Um , .. .. yeah . ... Yeah . ... Right . So it's ,  Well anyway , how can I -- How can I help you with all this  .   I feel like uh , we're .. still in a pickle , in that um , .. it's just , every day , is so different ,  and ,  ..  you know you're you're adjusting your insulins , Right . uh , per your , .. uh , protocols that you have there , and the carbos .. are varying .. around that , um , .. but , nan you know , I think it's important we , .. nan make some kind of a a goal , to .. prevent these lows from happening , .. Mhm .  and uh , try and prevent the ones that are creeping up a little bit too high . And , you know , what do you think , um , .. that uh .. you could do , to h-  clarify this a little bit  more and ,   .. Oh , make it a little easier .  ... Well , I guess maybe if I try this . .. M- .. maybe that's the only way . ... Cause it seems like to me that um , ... .. I don't know . .. I don't know . It's -- Maybe it's easier , .. if I have like some kind of set thing , cause then ,  Yeah . Something to shoot for . None Yeah . 2.. Kinda None , nan Cause otherwise , I'll just do whatever I feel like doing , Right . you know  .  Right .      2.. Uh , Obviously .       Well , .. you you could give this a try , as far as the levels , but what I would do , is , .. is use , .. what you're currently doing as sort of a backup .. guide . Because , .. obviously , if you're having , and and this has changed . A lot . Uh over the past few days . But um , .. well one day you have thirty-eight at breakfast . .. The next day .. you have .. none . Um ,   Yeah but that's like if it's high .  Forty ,  And it also , like sometimes I just write em in different columns . Cause , Okay . Cause uh , depending on what time it was . .. But , if you're having only , .. you know . Around , and what you could do is sort of .. round these . A little bit . Like shoot for say .. twentyfive , or , Mhm .  .. just say every morning , you're gonna have a thirty , Mhm . like a thirty gram carbohydrate brekfast . Period . Mhm .  That's um , .. it it would work . And then you just start learning from that . Mhm . You know , you know that a thirty .. gram carbohydrate breakfast would be an improvement , on what you were doing , as far as , .. dropping it down a little bit , Mhm . Mhm .  and yet , it would be , .. s- it would also be something kind of easy to do with toast , .. or bread , Right . .. Right . or English muffins , so you could just lock into that . .. And uh , .. see see how that goes . Um , uh , ... mid morning , well , that's kind of a debatable one , cause you don't really like to have the snack , Mhm .  .. but , .. try it . And see . Maybe carry something with you . And it could be something simple . You might make this just sort of a , a plastic baggie full of crackers . .. That you .. take with you wherever you go , Mhm . Right . and just make it a standard habit . .. Mhm . Or , it could be .. a piece of fruit . That is gonna be approximately in that ballpark . ... And , lunchtime ? .. I I would say maybe rounding it , .. I might round it to sixty . .. So , .. so what if we increase your .. quota up to about .. forty-five percent . Mhm . It's not a big deal . .. That that's not the most important thing . The main thing is that you're trying to hit those quotas .. consistently . Mhm .  Um , .. here , I don't think you'll have any problem eating something later on after dinner ,  ..    if anything it's , it's gonna be , .. trying to maybe keep this down . .. Mhm . Around .. fifteen to thirty , or something in that ballpark . Mhm .  But , ... I agree , that if you can make it a little more .. rock steady , you should .. be able to ooth some of these things out a bit more , if you have a schedule that you're trying , Mhm . to .. to go for . ... But these are a little bit more scientifically  derived , Yeah . Mhm . 2.. Mhm . based on , nan what insulins are doing , .. a- a- and when . Right . ... So ,   .. Yeah . ... Hm . Questions . Uh ,  No , I'm just , I was just looking at this number , and thinking , ... Oh , if I only eat that , amount of carbohydrate at dinner ,  I'll be just like dropping None . nan You know . All night long . With your -- And and , that is so annoying . It's like you have to keep eating , and keep eating . Cause I've had that happen .   Well , maybe realistically what you wanna do , .. is keep ... this one , ... because lunch , .. well what are you gonna have really . You're gonna have , yeah . A couple tortillas , or maybe a sandwich , or something along that line . Yeah . Maybe realistically , this is only .. about , .. forty , or fiftyish . Yeah . .. Okay . So that's fine . .. I would just ... adjust this , to , .. fifty , or fortyfive , or whatever you see fit . Mhm .  But dinner , you're right . You have control , .. in that you have a regular sliding scale , that you can use , ... and , maybe b , .. realistically you should make this .. seventy . .. Mhm . Mhm . And just , .. but , .. but call it seventy , and then really try to stand by that . .. And look at the insulin , look at your numbers before and after , and what does happen over the course of the evening . Um , do you have to go ahead and have this within two hours ? Or , Mhm .  uh , .. or what .   Mhm . But .. but look at it and see , but stand by it . Make it like .. seventy , and then just ... stick to it . None (%) Mhm . Um , ... Okay . So , ... Okay .  So , anyway . That's something you could ... play with for uh a little while , and see if if it um .. helps , .. in .. getting rid of some of the outliers . That we're .. trying to .. fix up . ... So , um , ... other questions . Uh , ... What'd you do Sabrina ? ... Nothing . ... I left the phone in my bedroom last night , and so I'm grounded from the phone None .  (YAWN) ... It was an accident None . You guys are always in trouble . What's up with that . Mom's a bitch . ... OPENDOOR nan ... Get your feet off of there . ... Get your feet .. off of there . ...

I know , I don't want any more . .. You don't want any more ? What about next week . ...  get some money , .. get some milk , and some , ... some of those peppers . ... Okay . ... By the way , .. gonna co- -- We're gonna .. co- -- ... pour some concrete in that .. breezeway . ... Oh no . ... I hate that noise . ... Oh shit . ... Do you know where the s- flyswatter is ? ... No , .. it's Curt's favorite toy . ... It's going , ... uhoh , Going , Hope that wasn't a drink . It was Marlena's . ... Well pick it up . .. Oh , it's gone Sabrina . ... Ooh ooh ,  Great . he's in the water now . ... nan Shall I turn the disposal on ? Ooh , .. ooh . Yuck . ... He's all yours . Yuck . .. Thank you Mom . ... Yuck . ... He went down . Well I gotta go out there and , ... and do that work . ... Is this yours Sabrina , ... Yes . ... See now I can't tell if this is dirty or clean . ... It's ... clean . ... It's clean ? It's white , Mom . ... Well ,  -- .. uh , just because it's white , Off -- doesn't mean it's clean . .. No . ... It it's white , means it s- .. shows dirt more . ... Stained . ... I'm gonna get a pair of gloves on . ... I think Curt still has your keys . ... It should be on the table . ... On the desk . ... N- I don't know . ... I don't know where my other glove is either . He -- Cause he um , ... Hunh ? When he came to get my car , he was using the spare . ... And , .. yesterday , when I was looking at , .. the ke- on the desk , it was .. the spare- -- My -- My .. original key was still there . ... You know what ? .. I think I'm gonna take , trade the spare ... key , ... for the original key , cause , everybody makes fun of my key . ... What's wrong with that key . I like it . ... Too big and bulky . ... You can find it though , can't you . ... Yeah , Should I put this pan , ... Um , .. Sabrina , did you ever give that , .. that card to um , .. Country Gentleman ?  , ... No , but we got a new one , that we gave there . ... You mean that one that I made , didn't , wasn't good enough ? ... No nan . .. We had already given like three .. to them already . ... Three ... cards , Well what did you guys do with that one I made . ... I'd like to have it back . ... Okay . ... I'll try- see if I can find it . Wonder where I put it . ... Hunh ? ... I'd like to just keep that card . Ooh . ... I left it at the carwash . (GULP) So they c- -- The girls could sign it . ... If the carwash was that .. little party we saw , I bet you they .. threw  away . N- n , It's probably outside and ended up getting trashed . ... I wanted to keep that . If you guys weren't gonna use it . .. I should've just done it myself . ... Hey you never know , it might have gotten  . ... (SIGH) ... Ask Kendra . ... She might have done something with it . I'll ask ..  . Y- you know , .. I -- I -- You know , it took me a while to make that thing . Well , I know , ... You guys just -- ... Yeah , ... I don't know why I bother sometimes . . .. Well when you said that though nan , m- .. my my new boss , ... she came -- .. She told Mike yesterday , she's I wanna be there at seven o'clock to go .. to community meeting . ... And so Mike .. is there at seven fifteen , he says , I wonder where .. she is . .. You know , ... and he says I get up , I wasn't planning on coming in until eight , and here I am early . .. And so she comes in , she says I apologize for .. for being late and everything . She's I forgot , we might have to scrape windows out here , cause she's from Arkansas . And so she went into the community afterwards , she's , it hasn't been a good morning she says , .. .. I bought .. four five pairs of .. new pants , before I left , and had em shortened . .. She goes and I didn't bother to try em on before .. I left . So she's all of em .. are not short enough . She's , .. these are the shorter one , and they're about two inches too long .   Oh man . ..  And then , .. she brought- bought a brand new attache case . ... And yesterday was the first day she used it . Put a bunch of stuff in it to read , went home last night , and couldn't get it open . The lock would not open . ... And she's , I don't think it came with a kay and it's this -- .. K- a key . And it's this beautiful attache , leather . .. One that she bought just before she left . .. She couldn't get it open . So Mike tried and he couldn't get it , and I says , .. uh , .. don't worry , I says , we'll get , we'll get one of the maintenance men , I says they can fix anything . Or get one of the kids , they could probably --   Well that's what I told her .  I said ,  .. one of the kids could probably have it out in thirty-five seconds , she's , I know . We won't --  We won't test them . So I had Bill come over , Bill comes over with his ... Leatherman Toolman , or -- Or whatever it is ? ... Few minutes , he had it undone . So she can't use it now though . Well , she says she has to really look , and it came with a strap too , she says maybe on the strap there's a key . .. She's and I didn't bother . She just likes it with the handle , not the shoulder strap . Mhm . So she says , it has not been a good day . .. My pants didn't fit , .. and she says they're too long . She says I hate em . They -- .. You know , and they were kinda long .. on her shoes ? .. .. And we were kidding her I says , .. just buy real high heels , and then you won't have to have em reshortened . .. Her attache case wouldn't -- ... Well , first , and then the windshield wipers needed wiping , and then the attache case she's , this is not a good morning . I says well , Mm . this is your second day of work , it only goes down hill from there . Unhunh and that -- That .. ice stuff was thick too , cause I took the .. blankets off my car this morning ? Mhm ? By the time I went out there again they were still f- -- They were frozen over , you know that that thin , .. Mhm ? just that .. foggy stuff , and I'm like oh my God . .. Why didn't you go work out this morning . ... Ma- my legs were kinda sore this morning , Still ? when I got up , so I thought that's probably not good . .. I'm gonna go tomorrow , but I was thinking , I don't wanna , Di- -- .. you know if if I did pull something , I don't know what I did to em . ... Y- -- Did you take the Tylenol ,  like I told you to yesterday ? Yeah . I took some this morning then too . Okay . Just to make sure . I think , ... you know , and you might be just a bug that , .. kind of a flu achy type thing . Yeah . .. Yeah cause Jenny had that flu today , she went home today and , .. a lot of people have had it , b- you know the like s- fall- -- Paula went in and found out to the doctor , she was tired of just having this kind of , ... just not feeling real well , and she thought she had an ear infection , Mhm . she went in , and she she- had a sinus infection . Mhm . .. Gave her some antibiotics . She goes at least I'll get over it then . Yeah . .. Yeah . You know so I think it .. just might have been something around , but God , that was the weirdest thing . .. That's what I did all day today , I had ... three or four different kids come up , and complain of , ... nasal , sinus problems ? ... So every time one of the doc- -- .. Their docs came on , I wrote another order and , .. I know , it's just -- called Bruce and , ... added their name . It's just one of these long going .. flu things . .. Bruce wanted to go hunting today , and every time I call him I says , you're not getting out here early .  And then finally he told me he says , ... uh , .. he wasn't going today with Mike anyhow . Mike left early . Mhm . None And wasn't going hunting . ... Today . .. So None , .. In fact , then I didn't leave until f four o'clock . ... And then him at the copier machine , ... I said so much for getting out on time on Friday . (YAWN)  .. Oh yeah ? Well I thought- -- Mm . I said Paula , I can stay if you want me to . Cause I wasn't doing anything , and we didn't do anything all day long pretty much , it was boring  . .. We had custom- -- Can I just have a little bit of that soup , just to try it ? I tried -- It's really spicy Annette . Oh yeah ? That's alright . Dad , doesn't cut up his onions , as s -- .. As ooth as I do ? ... And I think , when I made it , I used my salsa not his salsa ? .. Yeah ? ... And when the chili powder says .. two to four teaspoons ? .. He used the four ? I probably used two . He used the four . So it's real , ... It'll open up your sinuses . Well I like -- I like the onions . I just wanna try it . Yeah . It just ells so good . Well try a couple spoonfuls . ... And , ... I think I'll only cook it for about another half hour , and then I'll turn it off . Yeah . Um , ... because , .. well we had customer appreciation day . So we had hot dogs , and then we had the retirees come , and they're really nice ladies . And we got corco- .. corsages for em and stuff , you know they really like that . ... And um , ... they're like this is probably the last year you guys get to do this , with the merger , and we're like yeah , probably . .. But um , they were really nice , and , but we had hot dog- -- I just had a hot dog for lunch . I was gonna go buy something and I thought , God , why waste money on ... a hot dog , when I , or nan , on .. food when I could just eat a hot dog . So I had two of em , and I mean the first one kinda tasted pretty good ?    And I ate the other one , then half of the other one , it was like , whoah . .. Yeah . I don't like hot dogs that well but , ... and then we had cake . We had , ... that carrot cake from Costco , that carrot cake , Mhm . and the chocolate with the cream f- ... filling stuff , Mhm . it's not real sweet at all , it's more like a butter cream . Kinda thing and then , Unhunh . ... mints and nuts , and so I ate nut -- Oh . .. Those cashews , I just kept eating em . ... I ate more today than I probably have all week long though  .  ... ... And then , ... but , ... it was kinda nice . Well like I said I didn't do anything all day . ... Oh . I was busy all day -- Mm . Cause , ... we opened the annex yesterday ? ... So yesterday was fine . Well , yesterday was a mess , cause we were trying to move all the kids' belongings , and then all of our paperwork that has to move , You're all moving over there ? .. Again ? No . No . Just some ? It's just .. some . ... Well then we moved some of em over , and then we were wondering about staffing . ... And so we moved two of em back ,      Poor kids . .. So um , ... but then today I was the only nurse . ... Mm . So that takes , I mean when you're used to doing that all the time you , .. get up a system . ... Yeah . .. But , .. it was kinda crazy . And then , .. it was going pretty good this morning , and the kids were real real good , .. um , ... and then I was gonna get a new admit , and had to get her from- from the other unit . ... And uh , ... one of the docs came in and saw all of his kids , and wrote orders on every kid . ... So I had all these -- ... He'd change med orders , or add new stuff , ... and assignments and stuff so I had to take them all up , ... so about two- -- .. Ten after two I went over and got her , then I had to do all the admit .. paperwork and stuff ? Mm , .. I was late getting out of there .  .. So , ... So you didn't go work out today ? ... No . I g- -- I have to go tomorrow now . .. Oh and , .. you know how I get when my heart just beats really fast ? I got that as- at work , and usually , ... doesn't last very long , and it just , .. kept up and kept up and kept up . Cathleen has to wear a heart monitor because of that , mom . ... When did she get that . .. Yesterday . She got to see there- they- -- She had to go again today to take it have it taken off , Mhm . for twenty-four hours they wanted to -- ... Would hers do that , stop and then , ... get real fast and -- It just go beating real fast , and I mean she would just -- Well you've seen that on my -- .. Yeah . I mean it just drive- -- And she that she thinks it's her thyroid . ... Mhm ? Because and you know she hasn't been -- ... And she's been eating , you know , probably m- -- .. Same if not more , but I mean hasn't , .. it's just her body's just .. not .. doing well . Hm . So she had to wear that heart monitor , and Gordy said  , ..  you know they wanna have a baby , and he's like  ,  He's like let's have sex tonight with that heart monitor .  And Cathlene's like no way-  .   And then Patricia goes , wouldn't that be funny if your heart monitor went (BUZZ) ,  and then leveled out , then what- how would you feel . But Cathlene's like , you're not even touching me .  .. He's so funny  .  (SNIFF) .. It's like ,    I know he just needs a reason . ..  Oh this little baby came in   , he w- she was a week and a half old . .. Aw . (GASP) She was s- -- Her name was little Madeline , she was so cute , Madeline ? she's --  Madeline . And she was sucking her little thumb , bar- -- You know , .. and she w- -- She had her eyes open when I first looked over at her , sh- w- she -- .. ... Sucking her little thumb , she was so cute None . It seems like such an old-fashioned name for a little baby . Doesn't it ? Mhm . .. But oh . ... She was just adorable though . And she was so good the whole time . .. Hm . ... I hardly went anywhere , out in public , when you guys were a week and a half old . ... I mean , years and years ago you just didn't do that , ... y- .. tried to keep babies home and not expose em to germs and , ... all that kind of stuff , ... but I guess you still have to go out and do some banking now and then . Yeah , she was meeting with a investment officer , so , ... ... What are you d- -- .. Have plans for tonight ? (SNIFF) Yeah I talked Louis into going out tonight . ... I almost called Karen , to see if she wanted to take in a movie or something , ... but I came home from work , and then I didn't feel that great . .. So , ... Mhm . ... I lay down and I thought well , Diane and I are going to Sun Valley tomorrow . ... So I thought , well maybe I'll get some of my ... weekend stuff done , ... and uh , Mm . ... That's pretty good . I'm not hungry , but gosh that sure tastes good .  .. Well have a little bit more , we just won't tell him . .. Add some more water to it . He'll have this much left .   Yeah .   Well you know we were sitting here and , and , .. dad was in charge of the food then . .. ... And I says , well what do you wanna have , and I still have some spaghetti sauce , (SNIFF) and it was so cute he says , .. can I -- I think there's just enough spaghetti sauce for Lou and I out there , if I take that hunting , I says no , fine . ... Cause uh -- (SNIFF) After they hunt all th- day , they don't wanna spend all night cooking either , Mhm . .. So he says , well I don't know what else I can take . .. So I said , well why don't you -- .. I says that recipe is so easy . ... So I sat over here , .. before we went over to Diane's , and explained the recipe to em , and , (SNIFF) and uh , we stopped at the store and got the stuff , ... cause all you have to do is brown some hamburger and , ... onions , Yeah . and then toss cans of stuff in , and spices . .. He says that'd good , (SNIFF) and , ... then we wouldn't have to -- ... To .. cook a lot . And you don't end up dirtying a lot of dishes , Yeah . and that kinda stuff . .. At least they'll be out in wide open .. air , Yeah . too .   ? Mhm . (SNIFF) .. Do --  Well -- Yeah . ... Mm . ... But I I talked him into going out last night , I was like , you know I'm like , we don't spend enough time together . .. And then I was all- -- I did that thi- -- Yeah I was j- like , you know all -- I'm like well well fine , all on Saturdays I wanna go out with my friends every Saturday then . With my -- The girls then . ... He's like , that's fine . I said okay fine , then we won't have any nights together . I said , I see you maybe once or twice a week as it is , and I said , .. but you know , if you're , the guys night is so important to you , then girls night , ... I'm gonna start doing girls' night on Saturday . ... He was like that's fine . And I'm like fine , there just won't be our night then . And he was like , ... okay , if that's what you want . I said you know , .. I said God forbid , I go , we actually see each other more than two nights a week , I said , you know , our relationship -- .. You know , gosh if we see each other more than two nights a week , we might , you know , ... that's not good for a relationship at all . I said , we just should just talk on the phone a couple nights a week . And all -- And he's like yeah ? I said I'm being sarcastic to make my point , he's like oh . You're trying to make a point ? And I was like  , so I talked him in , .. to going out on this Friday . And he's like , ... this isn't gonna be every Friday now , is it ? And I said no , just -- You know , does it have to be stuck in stone , that you have to go out with the boys on Friday ? ... I said , cause I like to go out with all of our friends you know . .. Like a group of us ? .. I said but if we do that on Saturdays , then I have no- -- We have no night just for the two of us . ... I said  -- Well maybe that's what he's trying to avoid . 2 Well I know , 2..  That's what he s-  --  And I was like , hey .  And I said you know nan , .. I don't , .. I don't care if you go out with the boys on Friday I said , but does it have to be every Friday ? Can't it be like all of us once in a while ? So that , .. we still can have .. one night together ? .. .. Not every night and everything , I guess so . So I called Laura today . .. I'm like Laura , do you wanna do something ? She's like yeah , Koosh and I were just gonna watch a movie , she goes , but I wanna go out . And she's like , ... I said maybe we can go to Tepanyaki . She goes like is that expensive , and I said , .. oh , ... you know , I said I think that like under ten dollars , Sh- -- ... She goes cause k , .. Mark just called me about , .. we don't have any money this week , to pay the bills , and she goes , I told him that we get paid next week , just pay some of the bills next week . But he was like , oh . But , she goes we have to kinda watch it , for the ren- rest of the month . So , who are you going out with tonight . .. Koosh and Laura . .. ... And then w- -- Are you going out with just Louis tomorrow night ? Hopefully . ... Well you're going out with Koosh and Laura , .. for your birthday ? ... Probably . .. Afterwards , I don't know . ... ... I don't get home till eight o'clock anyway on Monday , I mean you'll be in bed by that time . I know , (SNIFF) and what else do you want for your birthday young lady ? (SNIFF) 3.. Do you wanna cake ? None Can you get me some pants ? No . ... Pie ? ... I don't want anything . Yogurt pie ? ... No one's gonna be here , I mean dad's gonna be gone , I'm not gonna be here ,  Mom's like , I want the yogurt pie  . No . We should just get one for both of our birthdays . Like maybe , ... Maybe we'll just have a nice dinner , middle of the week . .. sometime during the week , for both of our birthdays . Cause I won't be here for mine either . ... APPLAUSE  .. That'll be your- -- (SNIFF) One of your presents then  ? That's my present-  .  Wedding present ?  ... What kinda present ? What did you say ? ... That'll be your b- present . I thought you said that'll be your wedding present . And I'm like , No . ...  I was gonna say ,  3..     is it -- (%) Wha- (%) what are you saying .  Nothing . .. .. Hey I got him to go out on a Friday night , that's about all I can push it .  .. .. Anything more than that ,  .. .. But so I talked -- So Laura , and Koosh wanna do something , We're not really go to Tepanyaki though , but , ... What are you just gonna do , hang out and watch movies and stuff ? Oh , probably get something to eat and , ... Why don't you do something really .. reasonable for dinner . None Well that's None inexpensive . What ? That's inexpensive . What . .. Going out and getting something to eat . ... We're not gonna go to the Crow Inn again . No , but I mean , .. what are you gonna do that's inexpensive . ... Go out to eat . .. Like where . ... I don't know , like Burger and Brew , or something , you know ? Mhm . .. Just some .. casual normal place . ...  Dad didn't want all this hun- ... for hunting , you could have em over for dinner  . .. Dad there's a little left for you and Lou . .. ... But , it's like I'm not gonna be here on your birthday , is that okay ? I'm like I'm not  gonna be here on my birthday .  Why is he apologizing to you . How many years has it been since -- ... When he used to always go on my birthday . Well he says that , .. that that's your present , when he leaves   . Remember that one time on my birthday , we went out to dinner , just took his checkbook and stuff ? Yeah we did that that whole week . Yeah . ... That was great . .. That'll teach him , hunh ? .. Maybe that's how come he hasn't done that , That's  -- 2 Maybe that's it  , the last couple-  -- he'll go on my birthday now .  Is that some ginger ale ? ... No it's Squirt . ... Would you just get me a all glass of ging- --  .. There's a big bottle of it , .. down , ... in that ... bottle rack thing ? Yeah ? .. That's th- already open , and I drank out of it , so you can just give me that . .. The whole thing ? .. Yep . ... Jeez . Please .  .. ... Not gonna pour it , cause I'm not a waitress . .. Did you have more of that soup ? .. Yeah , you said I could . There's not gonna be anything left for your father . He's not gonna know . Just say you b- -- You put it to a boil , you turned it up , and it boiled over and . Some .. came out . ... He probably measured it  . .. I'm not gonna be hungry if we go out to dinner , I'm gonna be a cheap date  . .. ... ... Yeah . Well Tony wasn't there today , cause Amy had her wisdom teeth taken out . .. Oo . .. She's doing okay . They said her voice probably won't .. be back to normal , ever I mean , but , she called Jenny -- For Jenny this afternoon , .. Her wisdom teeth and her voice , I mean not her wisdom teeth , her tonsils . .. Oh . I was gonna say , man , I never knew the wisdom teeth , Yeah .  Didn't do anything for your voice , (SNIFF) you just talk as much as you used to . ... But , so we sent Amy flowers . Or my- -- They go , Annette call , and order some flowers . .. Call em , .. how much do you wanna spend . I don't know . I don't care  . .. I said what's .. what can you get a nice bouquet . .. Twenty twentyfive ? Sure . It's not my money  . .. Oh it comes out of the fund ? ... I don't know where it comes out of , they just charge us . Oh . Man I , ... I was supposed to leave money for Lettie's going away present . ... In an envelope there . ... And , .. uh , ... I was asking Anne what we were going to get her , for her new office . ... She decorates her home and her office , l- by Chinese ? ... And I thought this was really strange , cause she's Hispanic . ... You know . .. And and .. all y- -- When we went to her house , all the oriental things ? ... And I says what sh- Lettie needs , .. is plant- -- Cause she loves plants , but .. they die .. on her . ... And in her office , if I wouldn't water em and take care of em , she wouldn't have had any plants . God . .. (SNIFF) ..  So I says , .. what about a nice , ... either silk plant , or .. one of the silk trees , that would sit behind her desk then ? .. You know . Mhm .  I says that's very soothing , when she's .. doing therapy and stuff . And Anne says , that's a good idea . And I says you know , Costco has some real reasonable ones , (SNIFF) or you can , .. uh , .. silk warehouse for some of em . And she's , I think that's a good idea , and then she can , .. her .. real , ... other decorating she can do as she wants and prefers . (SNIFF) Yeah . Where's her office , where's -- Did she move ? Or is she still here . ... Well , no she's th- -- She's just going in with some of the doctors into private practice though . .. Mm . And do counseling .  It'll be -- Oh is she None gonna be at the hospital though ? .. No , Mm . She's just moving up front to the front offices ? Oh . .. Well so you'll still see her and stuff . ... You know the .. the one doctor , who lost his wife this summer , (SNIFF) when they were on vacation , Yeah . she's gonna take over her practice . (SNIFF) Oh . Cause their their therapy styles , are quite similar . .. Oh . .. And uh , ... you know , all these patients w- -- Since the death was so sudden , ... all these patients were just kinda left on a , Yeah . .. and so she's been illing in quite a bit . Hm . (SNIFF) .. Yeah , ... And that just kinda made her final decision , cause she said when she graduated from grad school , ... that's what she wanted to do , in five years have her own practice ? ... And she said but that's scary to do , .. Oh yeah . .. And she says , so the opportunity , the patients are there . .. So it was a perfect opportunity . It helps . Yeah . ... Even though the circumstances are not the best . ...   private practice . Hm . ... Mhm . .. ... When uh we sent Amy flowers , cause she's staying with ... her mom now . .. Cause she has to be watched . Oh . .. Yeah . (SNIFF) .. And so we go , we don't know if we should send em to Tony , or to Amy . Because , Amy and Tony , they fight like cats and dogs anyway . And then when you're not feeling well , .. and , you know , and Amy just flo- goes off the handle , cause Tony's no- -- You know no- -- ... Bugging and nosy and , (SNIFF) ... and I'm like I don't know who we'd wanna send flowers to , cause they're both gonna drive each other crazy  .  Well you're .. not the most pleasant person when you're .. sick . I n- -- No one is . That's the thing . .. Yeah . But they don't get along , I mean , that well . Well you just don't listen to me . ... I'm the nurse , and I tell you -- None I always listen to you . ... Annette you do not . Do too . .. Do not . Just -- Take your medicine . (SNIFF) Do this . 2.. That's the way Jenny went home today sick , and I said you go buy some orange juice , I said take some liquids , I said I don't want you going out at all this weekend . ... What did she say . Thank you mother ? She goes I'm not . .. Oh I said I don't wanna see you out . ... .. ...  One of the little kids came up to me and he said , (SNIFF) ... I got something to tell you Alice . And I said what . He said , .. I bit both sides of my tongue .  And so he sticks his tongue out and shows me , .. I said well don't do that anymore . And he says and it hurts like heck , and I said well don't do that anymore  . What a dipshit  . ..  ... And this one little kid who's been , really having a problem . ... The other day , ... he was tracking so well . ... And I says well , I says in the morning then , if you track really well , .. let me know , and I'll s- -- We'll -- .. I'll get the sa- tr- -- ... I'll save that tracking sheet , and give it to you . You can have it then . And you can show your parents when they come in . He was so .. excited , the next morning , I barely walked on the unit and he , ... he's screaming , Alice Alice . He says guess what , I tracked good all day long , then I forgot to turn it in .  So he still stayed on level three  . None ..  .. Poor kid . Mm . So I says , (SNIFF) .. And -- But he was okay with that . But he says I know I did really good , and I says , ... I know you did too , and you can do good today , so he did really good to- -- ... Today also . ... ... But he was the little kid , the other day before his mother came to visit . .. Physically worked himself up into such a state , that he threw up , three times , before she came ? ... Was he excited to see her , or didn't wanna see her . .. Well this is the new stepmother , (SNIFF) ... And he's really excited , ... but he's -- He's just such a hyper kid , when he gets involved in that , .. couldn't believe it . ... Mm . ... ... Wa . .. (SNIFF)  Do you have a bunch of homework and stuff to do tomorrow ? ... Well that'll be good , if Diane and I are out of here , ... Yeah . I mean I don't have a lot , cause actually this week in my , methods course it's pretty mellow , .. but I finally got a hold of Bishop Kelly , .. they finally called me back . .. About what . Someone there -- My observation I have to do there . ... I have to do twenty hour- -- Oh you are gonna do it ? ... Not my student teaching , my observation . ... Totally different . .. Well , .. who sets that up . You or , Well you- -- They- you just set it up through the , ... education department , they have to call and approve you to gi , Oh . I mean they have to say , you know , s- I have five students coming , these are the names , so you aren't just having these weirdos coming and saying , I'm supposed to observe your school . Yeah . You know ? .. And so finally Doctor DeLiando called me back today . ... I called Wednesday , and yesterday , ... and then he called me back , he called me this morning but I wasn't in yet . ... So , ... So when do you start that . .. I go in Tuesday . ... To meet him . .. And to .. get it set up then . Hm . So , ... (SNIFF)  . How do you say his name ? .. DeLiando ? .. I don't think that's how you -- Oh , that's what they told me . Oh , okay . .. I didn't think that's how you pronounced a good old Basque name but , (SNIFF) ..   Well that's what I've b- -- I mean that's , Yeah . ... So then are you j- -- Do you observe different teachers ? Or one teacher . ... I can pick . He goes , I'll introduce you to em , and he goes , and then you can pick and- -- Pick which ones you want then . .. You should sit in in ... Miss Brown's , and some of those , I wonder if she's still -- Those aren't English . ... Oh you have to do English , (SNIFF) Hunh , .. hm . .. I don't know any of the English teachers now . But , I , I'll probably -- I mean you get bored doing it , .. I mean and they want you to -- If you can help , you know , maybe grade paper or , Mhm , .. hm . do something , but it's also a lot of work for the teacher , to find something that a s- -- Yeah . .. That you can do just being there , ... an hour a week , or two hours a week . Yeah . So th , sometimes you can't . .. But sometimes you get bored , I mean I -- .. Watching the same class for twenty hours , that's boring . Just sitting there . Yeah . So I mean if you can get involved , it -- .. It helps you , .. plus , Yeah . .. it also helps pass the time , but , so I told Mickey , I'm like Mickey , I'm gonna be in late . .. Tuesday she's like , Annette , I don't care . You just make your own schedule anyway , you just come and go as you please , I don't care . Well I asked Cathlene I said ,  .. right after we got off the phone , I said I'd be there at seven fortyfive . ... Doctor DeLiando I said , .. oh yeah , Cathlene I said , since you're the one in charge today I said , I'm gonna be in late Tuesday . Is that okay ? And she's like yeah . Okay .   , that's a little bit , she's just leave me a sticky so I know . .. Yeah .  And then I go , I'll leave a sticky on Tony's , so she thinks that , ... you know , we include her in things  . ... I told Mickey , Mickey's like , I don't care  . ... What does -- ... Does -- ... Chris teach ... teach there ? (SNIFF) ... Uh , last I heard she did . That was last year but , .. Wouldn't it be funny if she taught English , and you got to sit in -- She teaches biology . Well I know -- .. Mom , Rats . You just don't know what's going on at that school anymore . ... Well I didn't know . ... That's sad about that kid in the paper ? .. Who , .. who's in the coma , he was a , .. the star f- .. baseball player at BK ? ... And he got that scholarship ? To , ... he was what a Gatorade player of the year , .. two years ago , and then he w- -- But I thought it was his dad who was , (SNIFF) in the hospital . No , it's him . .. He's in a coma . Oh . .. Okay . .. He got hit by that drunk driver ? And his younger brother . Plays at BK and has a football game . ... And I g- -- It wa- the pa- the- article was about , you know , how , ... they're all gonna g- -- All the family's gonna go to the game today , because , .. sports are very important , in this family you know , Yeah . and they all used to go watch , the older brother play baseball , and that's what he would want , is their family to be at the game and , Oh ,  um , really ? the coach , I think it's Tim Lincoln , or , Yeah . .. Yeah . one of the Lincolns , said , you know , if you don't wanna play , that's fine , if you d- ... don't wanna -- If you g- have to come out of a play , you just do whatever . But it was like , gosh .  Well that's like , there's a lot of pressure on this football ... team , Yeah cause , because Nick , .. Osetty's son is , Yeah , 2.. Mhm . I mean it's his dad , who's the field is dedicated to , Yeah . and he wants to dedicate his senior year to the- his dad , in memory of his dad , cause he was a star player . Yeah , so , .. And they play Kuna , and isn't th- always that your homecoming ? ... No , cause we usually lose to Kuna , so I think we had to p-  --  We always played like Payette , that we like beat every year , Oh . for like seventeen years , and then I think , our senior year , junior or senior year , we lost to em . And they beat you .  Yeah . Yeah  . It was like , None Oh God .  .. ... But , the only reason I went to the game was just to figure out what was going on afterwards , so it didn't really matter , I know . ... .. Well I never knew -- I didn't -- I could never even tell you half the players on the -- Yeah , you play football ? ... Mm I knew the ones that -- .. Mattered . .. Yeah . ... I went to a couple of the JV games , you know what I'm saying ? .. Louis's game- team lost , .. Wednesday though . So they're two and -- ... Mhm . Five and two now . They've only lost two games . They lost to Centennial the other day . Well I thought maybe , .. (SNIFF) that's what he was doing last night . Cause when we came by the stadiu- -- Uh the .. pavilion ? ... the ... football field . At BSU , the lights were on ? Well the seniors play , they have -- They have game in- -- .. The varsity has games Thursday and Friday . Oh . .. Okay . Cause they can't always get all the games in . Especially when it s- gets dark this early now ? ... Yeah . They have to have a lot more games , and then most of the schools don't have fields you can play at , in Boise . Don't have lights , no . .. But there sure were- -- So , There- .. weren't a lot of people there . Oh yeah . .. Probably -- ... But that was , ... seven o'clock , I don't know what time the game started . Ah , just kind of -- Their games usually start at seven , Yeah , .. on Wednesdays , Mhm . but varsity , Yeah . I don't know . (SNIFF) .. varsity probably starts at seven . Maybe it's an eight o'clock -- Seven , seven thirty ? .. Yeah . .. There weren't , a whole lot of -- Yeah , might have been , Mhm . ... They were probably may- maybe playing an out-of-town team , too . .. And I know dad said , .. yeah I don't know why they have the lights on yet , because it still was ... really light out . Yeah . Well they have to get em on , so they can , Yeah . .. get it going . .. ... And I thought maybe that was -- .. I thought maybe it was the sophomores . Yeah .  Well I thought Louis's game was at four fortyfive , I know they have one afternoon game , but it's next Wednesday I found out . And so I was gonna go and watch his game after work , you know , I get off work right at five , Mhm , then go , ... go to work at  and then , ... then he had a game at seven , and I was like oh . And then my legs hurt , I couldn't have walked anywhere , anyway . .. That was a weird thing . .. Mhm . ... Yeah cause Diane came in today , ... and she goes what's wrong with your legs . Mom and dad were freaking out about it . And I said it was , it was freaky  .  .. Well that's how come I called in the morning . .. (SNIFF) .. Yeah . You know , cause I didn't wanna go in and wake you up and say , how are your legs Annette and  ,  It's like , how the hell do you think they are  .  My legs are fine , but , I'm tired . None But I need some more sleep . And then , so then , I remem- -- Luckily I remembered , .. to call early enough . Otherwise I was gonna call you at work . Yeah .  But then I thought , that'd be kinda stupid , I call you at work , and if you didn't go to work they'll say , ... no , she's home sick today and , .. kinda like , .. what kinda mother are you . You live in the same house . Well , They know th- -- I mean , that .. we have different schedules and stuff . Hm . ... But yeah they're -- Like I said they're s- -- They're still kinda sore , like achy kinda sore , but they're , I mean they're , I can walk and everything , I think it's more of a flu . they aren't so , ... That's what I think it was though . ... Bug . .. Yeah cause I didn't have an appetite , or anything else like that , and I think that's part of it , I mean , Well , you could -- I have to be sick to , .. not eat . ... Now I've made up for it though . Today everything looked good . I was like , oh . Cause Jenny and I had to go over to the store and get the punch , and , ... um , cups and stuff , for the open house ? Today and , I mean , ... everything looked good at the store . And she was sick . So nothing looked good to her .  And I was like , That looks good , doesn't that look good ? No , no ,  ... That was like yesterday , after I got my car fixed . ... G- I went and took it in for , ... you know the , .. maintenance thing ? (SNIFF) .. And it was a free one . .. That's what you told me . Yeah . And uh , .. then dad wanted to go get that oil . ... For the fans ? .. To oil , ... put on the fans ? I said well you go do that , and I'll go to the grocery store . And I was hungry then . Cause this was three o'clock , and I had breakfast at eight o'clock yesterday . ... Man , .. everything looked good . So a hundred dollars later ,  I walked out of the  grocery store , and then we went last night . ... Oh to get stuff for the soup . For dad . Yeah . Oh , gee . For hunting . .. .  ..   No , he doesn't -- .. He doesn't .. call really ,  .. I don't -- The only thing is like at at home , sometimes he likes to sit by me and stuff like ,   I forgot to tell you , look for the house with the reindeer . You could find it a lot easier if you couldn't remember where we were . Oh really ? .. I always remember at , .. Once you get to it , Once I see it , I know , oh that's it . ... Yeah , I'll look at some of the houses , I'm like ooh , is it this one , is this one it , .. and then I just- -- Oh no , that's the one . .. Yeah , the one with the two reindeer that , Mark and Tim last year took and put on top of each other as if they were humping . I was like- . .. .. Neighbors are gonna see this  , so I went out in the morning I'm like , Oh None God None . None , .. so I get out of my car , stop in the driveway  , take em off of each other . I was like , I'll just kill them . Those naughty boys . .. But um , ... mm , .. no , he just -- ... He he , .. he's become more .. attached . ... and , .. uh- I think a lot of it is because a lot of his , .. friends have now gotten married , and have children , and he doesn't .. do as much with them . ... And I think that's why , but he has gotten so attached to me and it ,  .. I've always been very independent , .. and a lot of it had to do with like me growing up the way I did , with my .. my um , .. my mother dying , ... Mhm , younger , and then living with my one aunt , and then my I- aunt died when I was twelve , and then moving to another aunt , which was moving up here , and , .. I I've always had to go back and forth , I've always traveled on my own , I've always flown everywhere by myself , .. uh , .. I've always done everything . I've had to deal with my father , I- I'd listen to my sister , when my nephew .. started college , how she was saying , she filled out all of his applications for where he was going and , she did all of these things when he had to apply for a scholarship or whatever , she filled out everything , and I'm like , .. I did it by myself , you read the form , .. and you fill it out . .. Wow , No one did it for me , .. you know , and I was very .. much , .. whatever I needed , I I got my money from my father , he paid for school , but , I did everything on my own . .. I I didn't have anyone . See my parents weren't very , I don't know .  .. They're not .. extremely educated , and they're not , .. really on top of things , and so when it came to things like that ,  they wouldn't know how to help me . ..    Really , Yeah , they wouldn't -- ... I mean they had no clue , they didn't give me any suggestions of where to go to school , they said , oh yeah go to school , we'll pay for it . We want you to go to school . But they had no idea of , you know , what's a good school , what's a bad school , you know , any type of direction ?  Se- -- (%) (%) Yeah , They didn't give me anything like that . and see I feel that's one of the biggest setbacks ,  I I see this with with black .. youths today , is that , .. because your generations in the past , were not educated , .. Mm .  you have a harder time deciding on what's a good school , what's a good curriculum for you to take , .. your your parents aren't able to talk to you about it . W- just as you were saying , even though you're not black , but you were just saying that , but black children have that .. even more so . Right . Because you har- -- You're you're more likely .. not to be ha- come from educated parents . Whereas I came from an educated family , .. it was just the fact , .. they made us do everything on our own . .. And , Mm . but , .. .. black people also , th- those that have more , tried to teach you to be stronger . But I think they instilled s- tried m- tried to make me so strong , that they forgot , ... that I was a person . And I mean like , I I often feel like at times that , .. and maybe it's the gayness coming out in me but , ... I don't like it , like and when I was home , .. just went home to Indiana . I went to hug my sister , .. and I still feel that she finds a coldness in hugging . ... She doesn't like to hug . ..  No . My family's not very much hugging . .. Oh . I mean , my whole life , .. we've never been very , you greet someone , you don't s- hug them . You're just like hi , how are you , ... and even like male female . You don't do it . ... See uh my .. my mother was like that more so .  And then my father was .. different . .. Very emotional ? Very hugging ? Yeah , very hugging , they were just -- .. See my family is more ,  it's it's different . It's like , Mm . nan each member of the family is slightly different , .. and different a- amount of .. touch . ..  I always said , ... that if I had children , ... I would always -- Especially if I had a son , I would hug him , just so he knew that I loved him . Right . I think it's important , I think it's good ,  .. I don't think you can overly hug , .. um , .. with family and stuff like that . Yeah . See and that's how I feel , is that , I want to hug him , because I want him to know that I do love him . Mhm . And that , .. I I I want my children , .. if I if I ever had children , to know , ... that , there is nothing wrong with showing physical affection between two men . It doesn't make you gay . .. Right . .. You know , and that is one of the things that Scott was saying yesterday , it really bothered Scott a lot , because his nephew , .. uh , .. kept calling him Aunt Scott . ... Because , and his nephew was just being rude and obnoxious about every gift , .. he he unwrapped , and his brother said , oh that's just the way kids are today , and I'm like , no that's the way you train your kids . .. If you don't train your kids to be any better , ... then they are , and see and in Scott's family , like his brother , his older brother'll say , oh Scott's my best friend . But he'll tease Scott about , oh why aren't you married . You know , you must be a fag . Or this , and he'll laugh it off , and he doesn't realize , well yeah Scott is gay , and it hurts Scott . .. He doesn't know that he's gay ? .. Hmmm . .. .. Has no idea . .. He's probably he's gonna drop him off , which is why I have to close those blinds soon .  .. But uh ,    .. it it's the way ... he is . And his brother is just like that . .. And so , .. he , ... and h- and so his little boy is growing up the same way . Larry's twelve . .. And he's like this big kid , cause he's overweight . And I told Scott I said well Scott , I wouldn't take it personal , cause Scott was telling me this morning , I said , first of all , .. Larry's twelve years old , .. he's like six foot one , and he's fat . .. I mean , he's just .. probably a good two hundred fifty pounds I said , He's six one ? ... At twelve ? ... At twelve years old . Oh that's scary . .. And he's like two hundred and fifty pounds . And I said Scott he's compensating , for the fact , I said I bet you the kids pick on him , I said he's different . I said so therefore , .. he probably is a big bully at school . .. And I said , so he's probably just like this kid who's just like , .. real .. bitter , because nobody -- And I said his dad is just an .. a a jerk , Scott's brother , .. will call our house , and just , .. is just .. rude to Scott , .. But yet he'll turn around and ask Scott to borrow five thousand dollars . ... I mean like he just borrowed twenty-five thousand dollars from Scott , .. like two years ago , and told Scott , oh I'll give it back , I'm gonna invest it and I'll give it back in three months . So , he gives Scott -- .. It takes him instead , a year and a half to pay Scott back . Like w- .. Scott's got twenty-five thousand dollars just to lay around . .. Like that . .. You know and , .. that's the way his brother is . .. You know very , ... and he's just , .. he's just mean to Scott . He says things to Scott , .. just like , ... oh just awful things about gay and . Well , .. why doesn't .. Scott say something . .. Because , .. Scott hasn't dealt with his gayness himself , and he hasn't dealt with , ... who he is . Mm . ... And that's why he doesn't say anything . ... So you can't really blame the guy in the sense that ,  he doesn't know he's hurting him ?  If Scott doesn't stick up for himself , Right . And I keep telling Scott ,  you're gonna have to say something .   Because all of these things are hurting you . ... None Yeah . And Scott's like oh it doesn't bother me , and I'm like then why are you talking about it . ... I said i- if that would have been my nephew , and he would have said that to me , I'd've knocked him across that chair , I don't care how big he was . None  None     None Oh yeah . I said my nephews d- -- My nephews and nieces do not , one of the little girls ,  f- uh , tried pulling something on -- .. We went shopping , and tried the little attitude in the in the mall . And I grabbed her and I said , I don't care if you are my sister's child , .. I will knock you across that bench , in a second .  I said I don't have to take that .  I just it's -- You will never go shopping with me again . ..  Um , I just don't believe in it , and I I I'm sorry , I was not hit as a child , but I also was not nasty , like some kids now ? He's right . .. They do talk bad Some of the kids say things , but kids always do , but , that's not an excuse . RING Exactly . ..  RING ... Hello ? ... Hello ? ... What's wrong . ... It's Jimmy . ... Why . .. ... Why ? ...  ...    .. Okay , ... alright . Wel- -- .. Yeah . ... If you don't have enough gas and you're worried , that you're gonna run out , I wouldn't go anywhere either None . ... So why don't you call- -- I'll call you later on . Okay ? .. Bye . .. RING .. He's afraid that he's gonna run out of gas getting over here . Well why doesn't he get gas . I don't know , he drove all the way back from Green Bay with , .. just on that . And he thought he was gonna , like , .. make it , and somebody would be open , and I'm like , ... so he said he's like , it -- He said it's like past empty , it's past the E , .. and so he's afraid , .. that he'll run out on his way over here , and he probably would . ... Oh . .. Well he should just , .. go to a gas station . So he said he'll -- .. Well there's one down the street from his house , but it'll probably be open tomorrow morning . .. Oh . It's not open now . So he said he'd just rather stay home . ... Instead , and I said fine , go ahead and stay home .     But I don't know , I I really think that , it it's hard , (SNIFF) .. it's hard , .. it's it is hard having , ... to hide this like Scott's doing , I couldn't hide it any longer than he has , ... he's hiding it way too long . .. Yeah . ..  No I couldn't hide it that long either . ... I told my mother when I had like , ... my .. boyfriend moved away . ... She s- -- Is that why you told her ? .. Mm . .. Cause I was really upset . .. And then I s- -- .. And then she's like , well it's a good thing he moved away , cause he was sort of .. effeminate , ...  and I was really offended . .. That's how she took it ? .. Yeah . .. And I was really offended , cause she said something like ,  well it's a good thing , he was sort of weird , I didn't like you hanging around him . ... And I said what do you mean he was weird . .. And she said he was sort of effeminate . .. And I was like , well what do you mean , he's gay or something , she's like well I think he might have been . ... And I said well nan , ... why , does that bother you ? I said because I am . .. And she's like , ... no . You're not . I know you . You're not gay . ..   And I said , .. yes I am . .. I said , ... how do you know me , better than I know myself .   And she's just  looking at me , and she was like really upset . ..  Did she tell your dad or did you tell your dad . No , ... she ended up telling him I think eventually , but not right away . .. First thing I had to go to see a a psychiatrist .  .. Oh she made you go do that . Mhm , .. I went , ... Oh Jim's mother told him that too . .. See and then I went , .. and the guy's like really nice , and he's like well what what's why are you here ,  .. tell me what's .. what's going on . .. And I said well , How old were you at this time . .. .. Nineteen , .. And she said that's for the psychiatrist at nineteen ? She didn't think you knew , .. enough about yourself at that age ? .. Right . .. Well , she didn't want to believe it , you know ,  Yeah , I guess you can't blame em , some .. to some extent . .. So then I went to the psychiatrist and , he's like well what's the problem , and I said , well , .. my mother's upset because I'm gay .   And he's like , well it sounds like she has a problem then ,      Did he really say that ? None Yes . He said it sounds like that- she's the one with the problem . ... And I didn't even think about how I said it . I just said it ? You know ? ... And he interpreted w- how I said it , .. as how it was . You know , w- which is TRUE .  And you know what's really funny , is that a psychiatrist would say that , (SNIFF)  .. and knowingly know that , .. you know , he accepted the fact that yes you are gay , that it is something that , .. like when Mike told his friend Julia , .. Mike was telling me that Julia said , .. oh I don't like it , but if that's what you want , maybe that's not truly who you are . ... You know , and , .. I said to Mike , I said then Mike she didn't accept it . ... And , ... he said , .. well , .. I think she accepted it , she just said that , and he told her that he feels he was born with it , and she said , ... no , I don't believe that , I think it's your choice that that's what you want . .. And I said to- -- And I and I told Mike , I said you know , I hate when people say that , because , .. if I felt that was my choice , .. I don't think that would've been the first choice I would've picked .  Oh God no .  And it's not to say that I'm ashamed of being gay , No . None what it is is that , because of what society has done , or has laid the rules for us , .. I don't really think I would have chose to be gay .  .. I I wouldn't . .. Why would I want to be gay , and have to deal with what we go through . ... Exactly . And that's what I explained to my folks now and ,  ..  and they .. totally believe that it's ,  .. like .. hereditary or genetic or whatever , that it's not a choice . .. You know , because -- They do believe it now ? Oh yeah . They totally b- --  Oh , I believe it's .. it's -- I don't know if it's hereditary ? .. I do believe it's something . It's a gene , or it's something . Right . I I don't .. think -- I don't care what people say . You- you are -- You do not choose . Unhunh . I've known , since I was , .. ... gosh , .. probably , .. I can remember ? Four ? .. Five years old ? I remember that . Yeah . I remember .. looking .. at , ... my uncle was sleeping , .. on the couch , ... in our family room , and , he was sleeping there with his boxers on , and his .. peepee fell out of his pants . .. And I just stood there and stared at it , and I was --  And I know it was a sexual arousement , cause I can remember feeling sexually .. interested . ...  And so I was like four years old . ... So I knew then . .. You you know what you feel inside . You you c- you can't -- Right . ... And I don't care what anybody says , a- a- f- at four years old , I pick- -- I chose that ? That I ... liked .. what I saw , I don't think so . I don't think I knew at four years old , that I could actually just say oh , wow , I wanna play with this guy . You know , Right . I don't think so . .. And and if they say things like , oh when I was maybe seven , ... I slept with my cousin Tommy , who was probably twelve thirteen ? .. At the time , and I slept with him , ... no he was sixteen . .. Shared a bed with him , and he , .. uh , ... started fondling me , and I enjoyed it , and I fondled him back . .. And I was like .. seven years old . And .. I .. I don't say that he did it to me , he molested me or , r- or raped me as people are saying now , the older uncle , .. generally , I think these kids , ... Hm . .. not saying adults should've been more responsible , my six cons- cousin should have been more responsible ,  and not played with a seven-year-old child , but , .. he did . But I'm not gonna turn around and tell my aunt , well , .. gee your son , .. molested me as a child . Is he gay ? No . ... He's not gay . .. Well , .. we don't know .     .. Actually , .. I think he is . He brought home a drag queen for Christmas last year . .. So . .. Oh yeah .  None  .. But , ... at the time no . he ha- -- .. Like when he turned twentytwo , he got .. married , and he had kids and stuff , he has .. kids , which doesn't mean anything , there are a lot of fags with kids , but , he .. just is very , .. that was what happened to me . And .. and I don't blame my cousin , it was just another awakening experience for me , I mean there were several experiences , when I was growing up , I mean , I remember watching one of our neighbors , who was taking a shower , and you could see right through his bedroom , and he got out and he was naked . And I remember watching . .. And I remember being meerized by his body . ... I was never really that meerized by a female's body , as I was by a male's body , and so , Right . that's why I don't understand where uh .. they come up with this of , it's your choice . It's not . I I know , that that's what I felt . Well ,  I remember when I was li- -- I was like probably three or four ,  and I was wrestling on the , I th- I remember wrestling on the floor ,  with my brothers , and being aroused . Mhm . ... Just like .. goofing around and stuff like that ? Mhm . ... And then I think the l- -- .. The experience when I was younger , and my older brothers had .. friends over . .. I remember the f- -- .. He he he .. come over with these friends , with these guys , and I would just be like , ... in lust . ..   For these guys , I mean , I must have been like nine or ten , and I was just like ... idolizing these guys . Like oh my God , wow , ... I remember , I would like imagine like , .. if I could have them in my bedroom . .. See th- yeah . That type of thing . ... You know , of- oh if -- Mhm . .. Li- as if they were like a toy or something .  .. That was my older brother , because my older brother ,  .. uh , .. played football at Perdue , .. Mhm .  and I used to go to games , and I followed him around , he'd take me for weekends , and then I'd get to sit in the locker room . And , .. these guys would like tickle me , and hug me , and I was just a little kid . .. Cause I probably -- .. Mm , .. I was probably about ten at the time , ten eleven , and they just thought I was the nicest little boy , and , .. I just had , and I knew it . I was always sexually aroused by it . .. And -- And you know these things , and , .. you know it's inside of you . .. And , Mhm . ... you know , .. what what do you do . .. And I know my brother , ... who lives in Dallas , uh , the one that played football at Perdue , he -- He knew it . .. He .. he knew , he knew especially after Ron , .. because when I left California , I didn't come back here first , I actually went to Dallas . .. Because my brother's like come and stay with me , things'll work out , and , .. you can look for a job down here . .. And so , .. Ron flew to Dallas , .. and went to my brother's house , and banged on the door , and said I want to see him , we need to talk , and my brother's like , ... this is really odd for two friends , .. to be this emotionally attached . And I was like crying all the time , .. and like when Ron came , I started to- crying , and I was just like , just tell him to leave me alone , just get him out of here , .. and .. blah blah blah , and ,  Oh my God  . Now you tell me your family doesn't realize , now what is wrong , that two friends are , .. .. Having a , .. Th- a thing . They're fighting each other , th- one guy's standing outside the house at midnight screaming , let me talk to him let me talk to him , ... it is a little weird . ... You know , so , .. Yeah , I think they would figure that one out . Yeah , and my brother had met Ron , cause we went down there on a vacation of spring break once , and he thought we- he was really cool , and stuff so , .. he really liked him a lot , until that episode , and then , .. uh , I haven't spoke to my brother to be honest with you since . .. Really ? .. nan ... Why . W- was he like upset ? ...  ... No h , I think ... I'm afraid , ... Oh , .. I'm afraid that he's gonna come right out and ask me , .. Oh , .. about it , and what happened was , I ended up leaving Dallas , .. and coming back .. to Wisconsin like a week later , But doesn't he come up here ever ? .. For holidays at all or anything ? I won't go home when he's here .  Are you serious  ?   I won't go to Indiana , see I don't have any family in Wisconsin . My family's all in Indiana . Mm . So when he comes home , like if I know he's coming home for Thanksgiving , I won't go home .  He did call me one time , because he needed me to se- sign a property agreement , some property we own jointly , .. Mhm .  .. My -- There's eight of us , that my grandparents left us , and he needed to borrow money against it . So he called , .. and left me a message , I wasn't home , I was working , .. and , he said , gave me his number and told me to call him back , .. and , I called my sister and said fine , send me the p- -- Tell him to send me the paper and I'll sign it , and I never talked to him . ..  ..  So I haven't talked to my brother , ... see I've been in Milwaukee for ten years , so , .. about ten and a half years . .. Wow . How old is he . ... He's a lot older than I am , cause if I was ten and he was nineteen , ... so he's nine years older than me ? Oh , So he's -- .. He's older , he's in his forties . ... Yeah . .. He's in his forties . Don't you think it's it's more that you were just- ... nervous at the time None ,  Well now I'm gonna tell him . .. I've t- I keep telling myself every month , .. call him , and just tell him , because I wanna go to Dallas , .. and I wanna -- I I miss my brother . He was my best friend , and he knows . .. He .. knows . ... But , .. I just couldn't , ... just come right out and tell him then . I couldn't tell him , wel- -- There was more to it than that . Ron came to the house , he had a gun , .. they had to call the police , He had a gun ? .. Yes .   And he was standing outside the house , saying I'm gonna -- .. I'm gonna kill myself , if you don't talk to me , just tell me ,  .. and , .. th- -- There was just so much to this whole ,  This is the guy who doesn't know he's gay . .. Or isn't sure if he's gay . Yes . .. Yes . Who's now in the air force and lives in th- in South Carolina . .. So . ... Wait a second . ... I thought this w- guy was go- was married . ... Ron . ... Ron , .. he's married , right ? .. That's Darren . Oh , I'm thinking of Darren right .  No , Darren's the other guy that , .. was also in a frat that I knew in college , the one that I told , .. Oh those frat boys are too much . ..  I know  .  He was the one that I told , ... that if he'd had told me he loved me , .. I would have never left Washington and moved with Ron . I would have ... stuck with Darren . Oh . .. I would have never . Cause I never really , .. like I said , Ron was my friend . .. And I knew Ron was my friend .  .. .. And , I was in love with Darren . .. When I was in college , and to this day , ... if Scott wasn't here , and .. Darren wasn't married to a woman , .. I would be with Darren . ... He was probably .. the best ... sexual partner , .. I could ever imagine .   ..  Oh my God . None None And we never had sex . ... He's the only person I know who kissed me , when h- when he kissed me I just came right on the spot . .. You never had sex . .. Not , .. you know . ... Not the booty dance .       The booty dance  .      None Wow None . We .. had um , ... You had oral sex . Oral sex . .. But he was just , oh , ... and fine . ... And I don't like men with like auburn hair . .. But he had auburn hair , and these turquoise eyes , and he was like , .. six foot , and just , .. oh , .. and he still is . I was just like , .. he is to die for . .. I thought , .. .. why -- I was so young then and so stupid . .. He was the one that blamed me , None  None he wouldn't speak to me for six months , the first time we messed around we were drunk . .. And we messed around . And he wouldn't speak to me for six months , and said it was my fault that he knows he's not gay . .. But yet he was the one that grabbed me and threw me on the floor . .. He confronted you and said that to you ? And got on top of me . ... .. I called him , Oh . the next day after it had happened . And he said I don't want to talk to you , you took advantage of me when I was drunk . But he's the one that grabbed me , kissed me , ... took my underwear off , ... and , .. he started it . ... You know , I knew .. what I was about . .. I .. didn't .. get into it , but I knew . .. Right . ... And , he was the one , that was the first experience . And then the second experience , he didn't speak to me for three months , ... because he blamed me for that . And then , .. the third experience he blamed me for , he's been blaming me for all of these experiences , up until , ... uh like , .. Scott and I got serious like the year after , and I was still kind of seeing Darren , I went out to Washington and stuff , and that's when he stopped blaming me . Now , he calls me and tells me that he wants to be with me . ... And , .. he called -- Like he called me last week , and said he wanted to be with me . ... You're kidding . .. No . .. But he's married to Lauren . ... And I keep telling him , get out of that relationship , .. before you have children . ... Just get out of it , .. don't carry any by- baggage with you . ... Always my biggest theory . Don't carry any excess baggage . .. Mm . With you . And he loves her . But what he doesn't know how to separate is , he loves her but he's not in love with her . ... You know what I mean , he he just -- Right right . Oh yeah ,  you can love a person , .. but .. you're not in love with them ,  It's not sexual . ... Yeah . ... And that's really hard .  .. Because , ... you you find it very difficult to be , .. to love someone and , when you tell someone you love them , they misunderstand , what love is all about . So , ... I don't know . But I d- I , .. I think if there was ever anybody , .. I truly -- But he k- -- .. He , .. everybody has that one person who breaks their heart , and he broke my heart . .. Just incredibly because , .. I wasn't really in love with his looks , I just , ... I've never met anybody who when you .. they touched you , just , .. there was so much warmth . And so much , .. just -- There was so much .. energy there . .. That , .. I mean , So you've .. kept in contact with him ? None None Mm None , .. yes . Since nineteen -- ... Yeah . ... That's amazing . I've been here , for all this time , .. What does he just call , or you call , when he's -- No . .. He calls me . ... I can't call him . ... Oh . ...  Actually I can , cause his wife knows that we're friends . .. But I don't choose to call him . ... He -- ... Like he used to travel , around the country , (SNIFF) they live -- They used to live in Valencia California ,  now they live somewhere , ... they just moved , cause his wife got a new job . He quit his job for her , ... for her .. job . Cause she moved to California for them , cause they were living in Washington DC . So he used to travel all around the world . Well whenever he come to Wisconsin for the dairy expo , or he'd come here , .. go to Chicago for .. some reason , to take businesen around , what he did was , .. uh , he took f uh farmers around from arou- different parts of the world , so that they can look at farms . So his travel a lot of times was in Wisconsin , .. because of the farms here . .. They would see how .. things were done and , he- -- ... He like took them around .. the world . .. You know doing this . And he traveled all over the world . See , that's why , ... I think Darren now , is getting to this point where , .. he's with Lauren all the time . ... And before , Darren traveled like ninety percent of the year . ... He was gone . .. I mean , Darren was gone ninety percent of the year . ... So now he's with Lauren .. every day , and it's been this way for the last three or four months . .. And I think k -- Oh that's all ? ... For the last three or four months ? Oh -- He just started stop -- They've been married six years . .. He just stopped traveling . Oh ? ... And I think now it's just like , ... I don't know if this is for me , I don't know if this is right , and he's starting to call me . And he's starting to tell me how much he cares for me , and how he has feelings for me , and I -- I know that you're with Scott . And I'm just like , ... and I'm not giving up my life for you . .. He asked me once , right out of college , when he moved to Washington DC , ... when I came back , from California , and I was here , and I had just started working , he asked me to move to Madison . ... To be with him . .. That was when he was on the peak of thinking maybe I am gay . .. And I said , ... well , .. why don't I come out there first , and we'll see . So I went out there , and he goes , well yeah you can move out here and get your own apartment , whereas he owned a three-bedroom house , ... and lived by himself , and I'm like , ... okay , can I afford to move out here , get a apartment , until I find -- He never said move in here with me until you find a place or whatever . It was just like , .. and then he wanted the still straight life , ... and this and that and other . So now he claims bisexuality , .. but he's moving closer I think to steps of being gay , .. because when he was talking to me on the phone last week , ... he was telling me how much he still loved me . ... And he doesn't know what to do about this whole situation . How could he really love you though , he doesn't know you that much . He doesn't know me , because in the last ten years , we talked to each other maybe once a month . ... Well that's quite a bit though . And actually maybe not even that . Sometimes it's every other month . When he was traveling around the world , like he went to Germany for six weeks . And he sent me his frequent flyer ticket . .. .. Cause he was there , .. training to t- speak , learning to speak German in a six-week course . And he sent me ,  .. a free- k- to- .. to come and spend a week with him , and I said no . But at that time , .. I would- been with Scott like four years , and I was just like ,  .. I don't think so . You're not gonna use me , for your little sex thing for that week , and then that's it , so , ... I mean , ... I st- I love him , .. I really do but , None Hm None . I don't -- ... I also don't trust him . .. I don't think any man , .. who ... is as sexual as he w- .. is , ... and traveled as much as he did , .. could stay , .. celibate , or- or stay t- t- committed to his wife . .. Right . .. I mean when y- I saw him once in Chicago , ... I went to Chicago . .. About .. four years ago ? .. Five years ago ? ... And he was in Chicago , in this really nice hotel , and he said , why don't you come and , .. you know , I'm free Saturday , ... and Sunday . Why don't you come . And I said fine . So I took the train to Chicago on Saturday , .. and I thought okay no big deal , he'll have .. a room with two double beds . .. No it was a king-size bed . So I thought , okay , no big deal , I took a sleeping bag , just in case . So , here I am , .. taking my sleeping bag , I roll it out on the floor , and he goes ,   well you don't have to worry , you can share this bed with me , I love Lauren , ... and -- No I take that back . .. It was more than five years ago , because he's been married to Lauren for six years this coming May , ... no . Seven years this coming May . So it was more than six years ago because , .. it was when he asked Lauren to marry him , it was right around Christmas time . So it's been about six and a half years so , he asked Lauren to marry him , and he says I really love Lauren ,  I'm gonna marry her , and blah blah blah this . So I get in the bed , I thought fine , no big deal . .. I'm wearing my t-shirt and my underwear , so I get in the bed , ... and in the morning I wake up , .. and here he is , ... fondling me . ... So I'm like , okay , so , do you leave , or what do you do . ... You know , so nan , .. I'm like Darren , ... he goes , just don't say anything . And I said Darren , ... this isn't right , .. you don't really want to be with me , .. you just want .. the sexual part . ... And I said that's all there is to it , and I just can't do this . ... And ... he accepted it , and I I don't know -- ... He always , and he'll always ask me , well how's Scott , .. how is your sex life with Scott . .. Are you happy with Scott , .. you know , do you still miss me . .. And I'm like , .. well Darren I haven't told you I missed you in years . What are you talking about .   You know , it's like , k- excuse me .  .. None None Is he like full of himself or what . ... And he's another one too . He knows .. he's .. goodlooking . He he's another one . .. When we were were in college , he knew it . .. Mm . .. And .. and what really gets me is th- that , ... I think , .. the reason I always attracted , like I attracted a lot of football players , is people always .. got the impression .. I was gay . .. So , if they knew you were gay , and they wanted some .. experience , and they .. they didn't want to approach another .. say man in your frat . .. .. And they kinda thought you were gay , and nobody really wanted to like say it , .. they would approach me . .. Mm .  So I always got all the good-looking ones to always like , .. come after me . .. Mm . And that's how I ended up with Ron , and how I ended up with Darren . And I and I realize that , you know I always think well , especially Ron . I mean he was just like None , .. oh , .. just .. perfect . Well Darren was too but , Darren , a lot of people don't like auburn hair or reddish brown hair . They don't .. ca- care for it . But Ron just is just a- -- .. just a beautiful man . They both were but , I find that that's what happens in these fraternities . Is you find a man who .. is curious about his sexuality . .. And if they find someone who they question , .. okay , is he gay or isn't he gay , .. then they will tend to .. go after you a little bit faster . So then you think , okay you've seen some of these guys in the bars and you think , ... like I was out .. at the Triangle , and I saw this guy , he was so goodlooking , I'm like , how the hell did he end up with that .. thing . And then I thought you know , I betcha he's just out -- And he was from Marquette , and he .. was just finding out , and he met this guy , .. and that's why he was out with him . Oh , You know , I mean , When was this , it- -- .. This was probab- -- This was a while back . This was -- They young ? .. Yeah . Well the w- -- Oh . They were young . The one guy in particular was young . The guy that was from Marquette . .. Mm . Was probably , I f- -- I wouldn't think he would be more than ... twenty , ... twentyone , I couldn -- But he shouldn't have been in the Triangle if you want to know the truth . ... So , .. but , .. um , .. no , he was just very nice . ... (SNIFF) ..  Ow . .. Is he still a virgin ? ... Uh , Just out of curiosity , he bought a hooker . ...  ... But , was he .. a .. virgin when you knew him ? .. ... I meant , has he ever had a .. girl where he didn't have to pay her . .. Oh oh , ... he got , .. like , .. I told you about the time he got like .. a blowjob .. at the lakefront . ... No , you didn't . Oh no way . .. Um , well what happened was , .. I was just , me and Janine , well let me .. back up here . .. I started hanging out with Janine , ... Janine and I got ashed , and we .. like .. made out at the lakefront . .. I don't need the details . By the way , I saw the Janine last night . .. Oh cool , ... how's she doing . .. Okay . I haven't seen her in half a billion years , so , ... um , but anyways , we were like .. making out and stuff at Duncan lakefront , so that's what we regularly , well not regularly , did this like th- .. two three times , something like that . So after Victor's , after Tom had two women , like , ... fighting over who he's gonna go home with , he went home with this like uh , .. one other girl , like a heavy-set girl , and , me and Janine and all of us were walking down the hill . ... You know , going down , ... where the pier is ? ... Except , we were going down that big hill ? ... And it's like uh , ... me and Janine were used to walking down that steep grassy part , and they went around . So we hurried up and went in the grassy part , .. by the tennis courts . It was real dark , and you couldn't see us at all , after we had gotten .. to that little plank . So we like hurried up to this one spot we always went to , we sat and looked around , and Tom and them were yelling and screaming for us . .. You know and they , .. started making out , like , .. a hundred yards away from us . .. You know , .. but there's trees , and they were standing , ... in front of a tree , .. so you couldn't see them , and we were sitting by .. like .. a tree , so you couldn't see us . ... So they were making out , ... and we're sitting there talking and stuff and junk , and then it's like , all of a sudden we hear , ... ... and that was just the damndest noise , and a very distinctive noise ,  so , ... I'm like , ... I know they're not  doing what I think they're doing , and we're looking around the corner , I couldn't see anything . .. And then all of a sudden , I saw , ... Tom I don't know , took a step back or something , and I could see Tom . .. Or something , I don't n- know , on this side of the tree , and then I saw ... a head . Or a movement .. lower ... than what I saw Tom . So then the picture became clear that , he's getting head from this chick he didn't even know ,  And that was kinda cool . ... So , ... I don't know if he , So did he do her , or did he just get the blowjob . Just the blowjob . It's like , .. it was getting late and she had to work in the morning .  ... But , and that's the first chick I ever saw him with here in the United States otherwise . ... He's only paid for it . You know . ... Did he pay for it back home ? Or , Yeah , fifty bucks , for hookers , ... well , .. it's kind of a good price , I mean , ... nowadays here , you'd have to like , ... you know , .. pay fifty bucks to go out to dinner and a movie , and then you have to be real nice , ... and then maybe just maybe , something might happen , if she likes you and , if the wind's blowing in the right direction and , just no one tripped over anything earlier in that day , and well , ... take fifty bucks , go get a hooker , and then , .. go out with your friends  and have some fun . .. Or you could always go down to that one strip in Chicago . ... What strip . ... The one over nan , .. by Crowbar ? ... No ? ... It's like .. by the bridge ? ... Okay what , .. what's , .. what ah- -- There's like a whole strip . That's like that whole strip right there . There's all the -- the classic type of prostitutes None . Really ? Yeah . Hunh . It's like , if you go in the summertime , I m- mean it's just lined with em . Wow , .. thanks for telling me . Just .. literally .. lined with it , lined with em , and it's like , ... all these cars are like pulled over , and they're like , y- -- It's like , ... ... Wow , It's -- You see all these ... these hookers , and , you're going ,  ... okay ,  it was like , so- -- So the one time I went with uh , ... John and .. Zeus , ... to Crowbar , ... on Fourth of July and they're , .. they're all lined out , there's like maybe , probably about a hundred prostitutes , walking up and down the street ,  and ,  ... uh , ... I was like well , ... hey , ... Zeus . It was like , .. you need a girlfriend  ?   .. Cool ,  He was like , uh , no ?  ... So , .. and then , .. there was , actually , there was a pr- -- a Russian prostitute , in Victor's , on Wednesday night . ... Really , I didn't see her . ... She was j- -- She was like standing right by us . ... And , .. it's cause , Mary was like , .. oh my God , she always dressed like an alien . And then she always looks so goofy . And , No , I had never s- -- I didn't see her . Where was she . ... Uh , she was to my right . ... At the bar ? ... And she had these like spandex pa- -- I mean she did look like kind of like she had a space outfit on ? ... It was like ... black , and it was like the skirt flared out and shit ? And it was just , she kinda looked like a Judy Jetson , I mean she looked really goofy , No . You gotta .. point her out .. like Wednesday . ..  .. And , ... I was like , .. oh my God . You know ? So , ... I'll bring some extra money , .. no ? .. Um , .. Mary said , it was like , she's a .. prostitute , she's really weird too . ... Wow . .. That's kinda cool . .. Yeah so , ... anyway , that , .. and then um , ... I'll never forget the one time Rob and I went down to Chica- -- .. I went .. to visit Rob in Chicago . It was a Sunday afternoon , .. it was like , ... probably like three or four in the afternoon . We were like , let's take a drive around the city . You know ? Just ... for a Sunday drive . So we were driving around in the city and , all of a sudden we see the classic hooker . She's got , the fishnet stockings on , obviously she's like a five-dollar hooker , Yeah . trying to get her f- -- her afternoon fix . So that she can ... go get drugs .  And she's got ... her skirt , she had a miniskirt on . She had her sk- her hand in her s- -- She's like ... exposing her bush , ... and , ... it's like , ... you know , using her tongue and shit , and she's like leaning , she's like come here , like this to us , and we're like , ... uh , .. keep driving .  .. We were like , oh that was just nasty . She just looked nasty .  Wow . Well you could've .. pulled over and said hello . ... No but , the only hooker I thought I saw , ... okay , I think I told you about this . When me and Steve Greg and ... Tom went to .. like .. Chicago ? ... Did I tell you about that one day ? Oh I love that . .. Yeah , ..  I remember that . that hooker --  It was like , oh come on guys , I'm not a carjacker .      Well yeah , but , .. no this hooker was kinda interesting . .. Um , we were pulling .. near .. Crowbar , we were looking for -- pulling out , uh , we saw this hooker . ... Across the street . .. Kinda waving us over . ... And I'm looking at it , and everyone's like saying , yeah , pull over pull over pull over . ... You know , and I'm like , okay , this is kinda cool , ... uh , ... so , ... I'm thinking , okay just for a joke , we should pull over or say something . ... But then , ... I looked over to the right , ... and there's this white van . ... Clean white van , in .. ... warehouse district . ... You know , sitting there , ... you know across the street from this hooker . ... And I'm like , .. no , I'm not gonna be on Cops . Cause that's what it was . .. And then she eventually like , we started drive away , and then she started walking towards the white van , it's a front man , ... but , ... that's the only hooker we've seen . ... Oh no this one , on , ... that whole -- ... It was like you know when you go -- ... When you .. turn off the freeway , by that Blockbuster , and you turn left ? Mhm . Okay . ... It's like y- -- W- -- .. And you're going straight ? And you go over that bridge , ... just .. before you hit the bridge , and on the bridge , ... until you get to that street that .. you turn on Crowbar , it's all lined with hookers , in the summertime ? .. T So why don't they like bust em . .. No there are cops there that bust em , ... They just keep going back though . Yeah . They just keep going back . .. Wow . It's like , now it's too cold .. for them , .. but , ... uh , ... otherwise .. they , ... there's like , the whole strip is just the classic type of .. hookers .  .. Thank you for the information . .. You're welcome ,  ... I'll sure remember that . Next time I'm like , ... feeling kinda bored . ...

Well you don't have to put on any clothes , But it's like , y- you know it's like I have to , .. also watch Melrose Place . .. Oh lord , I avoided -- ..

Billy finds out about , ... his .. little bitch wife ... lied to him , ... she uh , ... told him that she was pregnant ? ... Yeah ? And she exhibited all the classic signs and shit ? And they told everyone ? ... Well , .. it was , .. turned out that she just wanted it so bad ? ... That uh , ... that ... she ... had signs that she was pregnant ? ... And , .. so , now she's like uh , ... he's gonna divorce her I think . Thank God . ... Man , ... Cause he belonged with Billy , or I mean .. Allison anyway . ...

So um None , ...  Now my dog is gonna lick my coat . ... Why is my hand so tender today . .. nan .. I don't know , Usually I can open this . ... Without help . .. Mm . .. Shit . ... (SIGH) ... One of these days I'll have a really fun drunken New Year . ..  .. .. Well , maybe next year . Because I'll be , .. it's like , there's no way I work in another , ... it's like , I'll be out of ... bar business by that time . Cause I'm not working .. another fucking New Year's . I wouldn't mind going into Chicago . .. Yeah , that's what I wanna do . ... That's .. gonna be my  plan , oh , .. um , so far I've talked to everyone , everyone said yeah , but , who knows , the money might not be there . We're planning to go to New York in .. nineteen ninetynine . ... Cool . ... Two thousand we're gonna be in New York somewhere . .. You're welcome to come along . That'd be cool . .. I thought so . ... Well hopefully I won't be with Natalie by then so . ... Which'd be- -- God I hope not . Yeah , .. That'll ruin everything .  .. .. Yeah , .. my social life is going downhill . ... Well my social life is naturally going downhill , because everyone I know is getting old , TELEVISION which really sucks . ... Shit . Football . ... I hate football . ..  Yeah , same here . ... Everyone's getting old , no one wants to drink anymore , everyone's got girlfriends that they care about , ... I know , it's like I don't even hear from Gregg anymore , ... what's up with that . ... I don't know , he , .. Kathy's gonna be gone for two weeks so , So all of a sudden he- it's like , .. he's gonna spring back into our lives , hoping ? Probably , I don't .. think so . ... Well ever since he heard that I was having problems with my band , you know , he's been calling me a lot more , we've been hanging out and stuff , ... ... I just .. really -- .. nan ... That's what pisses me off . Cause like , the same thing is going on with uh , ... with ... Marlisse . ... You know , it's , ... it was like , .. all of a sudden , ... well here we did all this stuff , ... and , .. for about a month now she's had a boyfriend ? ... Mhm , And , I call her , .. she's never home . .. It's like , ... uh , .. I got a hold of her .. yesterday , actually , ... I mean I even tried to call her on New Y- -- .. on Christmas . .. And she wasn't there , ... and , ... now it's like , ... I'm like , uh , where the hell are you ? You know , and , ... I haven't seen you in a while , Mhm , ... like  I'm sorry , and then she's going out of town , .. Florida for , .. till like school starts now , ... on the third , .. Yeah , ... ... So , ... It all sucks . I remember this story , .. ... It all sucks , because , it's one thing like for me and you to hang out , and stuff like that at Victor's , and whatever , but , ... we're at two to- .. totally different social levels . I mean it's easier for women to walk into a bar , ... not know anyone , and then come out knowing everybody . It's hard for a guy to , because then he comes off like a big huge pervert . So , .. I'd have to be chasing you around , and cramping your style , it's just cool that , all the girls go out , and all guys go out , and if you're two social .. whatever , at the same bouncing around know everybody level , it's cool . .. You know , ... cause I don't wanna sit here and drag you down , and ... stuff and junk . TELEVISION Cool . ... You remember this story ? No . What is it . This -- .. This guy , .. this is a TRUE story , ... uh , ... he took a -- ... It's -- .. Well it took em like tw- -- over twenty years to catch this guy . He went and shot his entire family . ... And then disappeared . ... Well ? ... So why did he shoot his family . ... Cause he was afraid that their morality was going downhill . ... Well , ... yeah ? So he shot his mother , his kids and his wife . ... Oh and his daughter . TELEVISION ...  Uhoh , .. then the milkman comes . .. I can kick em , I can kick em . TELEVISION  ... I -- ... I don't think it's all sick and twisted . TELEVISION You know the last time I s- seen gr , it was like , ... last night I was f , .. watching- -- You know it was like , I was at Victor's , and all of a sudden I saw Showgirls ? Mhm ? Was on , ... or , on videotape now ? ... And ah ,  TELEVISION Cool .  Shoot her . ... Don't have her look at you . TELEVISION That was the last time I did anything with Gregg though . ... That was when , ... Oh , and you know what also hap , is like they wound up not , ... their bod- -- Since he like .. cancelled all this stuff , and like he pulled -- He had said it's like , you know , I'm pulling my kids out of school , I'm taking em out , ... out for a vacation and shit ? ... And all this and that , ... so no one suspected that the family was dead . ... For how long . .. A month , or two months , Wow . ... So they were like laying there , in the house , and all of a sudden it's like started stinking , and someone walked in the house , and found all their decomposed bodies ? And he , by this time he had disappeared . TELEVISION ... Cool . TELEVISION ... Cool . TELEVISION ... Cool . ... Works for me . TELEVISION ... That's rude . So . ... After twenty years , they could let the guy go . ...  .. You know , He killed his whole fucking family though . ... Yeah that's twenty years ago . ... He didn't do it since . ...  .. .. At least they're now moral . ... Ts  ... What . ... I can't believe your rationale . .. You know I was just joking  . ... I would never , ... like you know , seriously , think about walking up th- behind someone with a gun . ... And like .. pulling the trigger , .. and watching your brains splatter all over the nice white -- I mean , .. I mean , all over the wall . ... No I'm just joking  . .. Just wanted to scare you a little bit . .. Did you catch the little reference to white wall ? ... You know whitewalls , see ,   get it , .. no I'm just joking , ... (SNIFF) (SIGH) I wish I was at Metropolis yesterday . I think it would've been cool . .. I think .. Gregg and them would have been a little bit more motivated . ... Than at The Planet ? ... You know , cause there's no food or nothing ? .. We didn't have food either . Well that sucks . ... New Years are going downhill now . ... We used to . ... I think I liked her before . ... With all her chubby stuff ? (SNIFF) Yeah . ... I don't like em bone thin . I still don't -- I think she's ugly . .. Yeah , still ugly , yeah I know . ... But , I like- -- I don't like ... like .. super skinny .. railly , .. rib poking me in my like whatever ? You know ? ... ... I like it when you can like .. poke a female , and she jiggles for like two seconds afterwards ,  I like -- I like that . ... (SNIFF) ... I like em healthy . ... I like when we can sit down to -- Robust ? Yeah . Well then I don't understand why you like Rita . ... Cause she's got like awesome eyes . ... Oh . But she's like a s -- She's like a ... walking skeleton . Man . I agree , but she's got nice eyes . ... I mean I I .. I like her , but um , I mean we never , I could never date her . ... Cause there's a difference for me , I like a lot of people . Like for instance , um , ... your friend ? ... Oh Beth ?  Yeah . ... I could date her . ... Did you just like accidentally tell her what I told you to tell her ? Yeah . What'd she say . Well actually she was interested in that guy at the Country Kitchen . .. I know . ... That sucks . ... My heart's broken . ... I'm sorry , ... Mm , ... now do you see why I didn't go ? ... Yeah .  But it turned out he didn't even show up I guess . .. Ahha . Where -- ... Good . ... F- -- T- you can tell her I said that too  .  And it's got me on tape saying it . ... Damn it . TELEVISION Wow . TELEVISION Cool . TELEVISION To just burn his house ? TELEVISION No . TELEVISION ... Eighteen years , let the guy go . TELEVISION .. Ooh . This was the first time that it was done ? TELEVISION Wow . TELEVISION Recede , ... Hm ? TELEVISION Wow . TELEVISION T- -- ... Hm .  Why wouldn't you leave the country . .. I would leave the country . Yeah . ... I'd be pissed though . .. I mean , ... twenty years to get away with it , all of a sudden , ... police .    Bad . ... I don't know why . .. It's , .. like why would you wanna stay there . ... Uh stay in the United States . If I would -- ... I mean nan , if you could commit the .. perfect crime , .. get away with it , .. would you stay in the country , .. or would you leave . ... It'd be kinda hard to like , ... go to a like another country you know ? ... Espec- -- Well I mean , he had like twenty thousand dollars . .. Okay ? .. In nineteen seventy . In seventy . ... That's like .. so , ... so it's like , all she had .. to do , ... he had to do , was like get on a plane , go to England . .. Get a work permit and shit , .. Mm . ... Had some -- He had a thirty-day head start . ... Yeah , that's TRUE . Plus he was already at airport . ... Could've jet somewhere , Yeah . TELEVISION TELEVISION Woah . TELEVISION I wouldn't carry my own .. paperwork . ..    Forget that , I'm guilty , I wouldn't carry it . TELEVISION T- -- TELEVISION Ah jeez . I it- -- ... Insanity , ... I mean it's it's , kinda reminds me of that , ... co- -- It's like , .. I I'm surprised something like him di , ... you know like uh ... Dahmer ? .. And what's his name , Mm . that other guy ? .. Mhm . ... Did happen to him . ... Cause they're like weaker type men . .. You know in prison they'd never survive . ... I know . .. Not if you hurt women . ... Then you become one .    ... Even though it wouldn't be bad , Well , to have some guy named Bubba , well , we won't go there . ..   .. Well that doesn -- Been reading those books is like , oh my God , it's like there , .. there's this one , ... like they ... tell like .. the .. different guys' point of view sometime ? And this one guy , (SNIFF) ... he uh , ... there- -- .. Well actually they tell like a couple different guys' n- point of view , ... and the guys get raped too . ... Ah . And then like , .. and then they'll like .. take these ... butt plugs , or whatever you wanna call em , .. and they'll shove it up their anus , ... and , ... they have to walk around with it ? .. Ah , .. And then they have , .. it's like , ... sometimes they'll like .. stuff this other gag in their mouth , that's the shape of a penis ? .. And like tie it on their face ,   And they have to walk- -- And it's like , this one ... guy was t- say it was like , ... they got sent to the village . .. Which you don't wanna get sent to the village . ... But they do . .. And , ... they go , .. it was like this one guy , he gets this master . .. And , ... he winds up , .. the master fi- .. falls in love with him , but he was like , .. like the day before , he makes him walk around , he's like a m- .. human .. pony . ... And they stick the , .. the thing up his anus ? ... And it's got like a horse h- -- A tail . A tail . Yeah .  And , he has to run around the city , he's like pulling a cart with these other people . ... Pulling this cart around , with this thing up his .. butt . Mhm . And , ... it was like , parade around like that . That's cool . ...  Ah oh , And , I'm just sort of going , ugh . Why . None Ugh , so nasty . Why is it nasty . ... I don't know . .. It -- I was talking to my .. one friend to uh , .. ... her name's Leah ? ... And , she's Iranian . Well actually she's .. quite cool , she's m- -- .. She's Muslim ? It's like , .. she uh , .. she's not a virgin . ... But , ... uh , .. Ooh , she could be stoned . ...  .. Go ahead . But , I mean , but she's been raised here . ... Ah . ... Really ? Is she single ? .. Uh , ... no , she's uh , ac- actually her boyfriend's coming in from Morocco . ... Okay . ... No , I was just joking anyways but , But , Can I see your Marlboro case for a second ? ... Just keep talking . .. And uh , ... anyway , ... she uh , ... they ran out of Marlboro Lights at work , so I had to .. go to Marlboros . .. And then I'll t- show you something about these . ... Okay . ... But uh , ... .. anyway , ... we were talking , cause it's like I was .. telling her , we were talking about .. this .. these , I was telling her about the books I was reading , and then we got on the subject of .. anal sex , and I .. told her I was like well , I remember when , ... my ex-boyfriend tried to get me ... to try it ? But I said- -- Always told him no ? .. Mhm ? ... Things are meant to come out , not go in ,  in that hole . Hm .  She said that she had done it ? .. Like twice ? ... She's like , oh my God I feel so dirty whenever I do it , and it hurts so fucking bad . Mhm ? ... And , ... that convinced , I'm like , .. okay- , she's like , don't do it ever . Mm . ... Cause the one thing that's like , .. when I , ... what -- .. When uh , Lamar kept pressuring me to do it , and she said that like , when you , ... in ... the Muslim , it's like if you do that , ... you know , it's like , ... in .. Islam you're cons- .. not considered .. Muslim anymore . ... Oh ? If you have anal sex . ... But I remember like uh , ... Lamar telling me once that , he had a girlfriend ? ... Back home ? .. And she didn't wanna lose her virginity ? ... They were gonna have sex , so it's like instead , they always had anal sex ? .. Instead . Wow . ... And , .. I'm like , ugh . ..  .. Ugh . ... Wow . Okay what are you gonna show me . .. This is interesting . I didn't know this until like , I l- .. I listened to ... Def Comedy Jam . This guy was telling jokes about Marlboros . ... And how they're racist . ... Did you ever hear this ? No . ... Did you ever notice a Marlboro , the sign ? ... That , this thing right here ? The filt- -- The whole red thing ? ... The red thing ? ... Okay , .. Okay , now y- -- Are you watching me ? .. Yeah , ... It's a kay . ... There's a kay . ... There's a kay , ... okay you with me ? Unhunh ? ... So , .. here's a kay , ... here's a kay , ... here's a kay . ... There's no kay . ... Three kays ? ... Oh . .. Get it ? .. Never even thought about it . I never did either . Until I looked at this and I'm like , ... well there's room enough to put another kay here . You know ? .. Somewhere , ... but there's not . ... Get it ? ... Yeah . There's no kay anywhere else . ... Three kays . .. T nan ... .. But it's , (COUGH) I just thought .. you'd find it interesting . ... Anyways cool . .. .. ... Okay . ... What is this guy doing now . . ... ... Hey man . Hey . ... Good to see you ,  ... well , ... I see you went ahead with your plans to do a little skiing there ? .. I did .   Well , I'm glad you didn't hurt yourself too bad , Me too . and she says you're getting better already , ((DOOR_CLOSING) so that's always a good sign . .. Yeah , I mean I couldn't -- ... I couldn't begin to deal with the slightest pressure . Yeah , give it easy easy , yeah don't -- ... That still hurts back here . Yeah , .. yeah . ... Well , you don't want to .. stretch , see what happened , you st- -- ... Ch- -- .. According to this other guy , you stretched your ligaments in there , and the ligaments are the things that hold your joint together , keep it from flopping around so , if they get , ... you know , stretched just a little , when they try to peel down , and tighten up , and you don't want to , ... you know , get em too lax while they're trying to tighten . You know , you want to let em .. heal as strong as they can . I mean you can move it , I'm not saying you got to go around with it just totally ,  but you don't wanna stretch those ... ligaments very much when , while they're healing . Just -- ... Just gradually bring it around . .. Okay . Are you using any kind of walking aids . Hmmm . Nope . ... Just walking around . Hunh ? .. Yeah , I had , for the first two days I had a crutch or two . .. Okay . I switched from two to one , like a cane , and then I , Yeah . Okay . ... Uh , .. it was really .. icy there , so I , .. it had a spike on it , so I -- Oh , that was neat . ... Yeah . Peg it in the ground . .. If you forget , and walk inside with your spike , I guess you're not too well appreciated . (SNEEZE) No  . Bet you  . .. No ,  .. Let me set you up there . Is it okay if I record this , I -- I already have -- Sure ... It's for a project . Sure .  Sure . ... Cool . ... Alright , what are you doing over there . I thought you were doing something .. different . I thought you were working with languages in -- ... Oklahoma ? Hunh ? ... Or in California . I mean , well yeah , y- California your basic project , I was in linguistics . That's what this project's for , Yeah that's -- but , ... I did a year of it , and decided it wasn't quite , .. what I really l- -- Quite , quite what you want , okay . Yeah , it was an unfortunate , cause I really don't know quite what I want  . ... Well that's alright . ... I mean , there's a lot of things out there , you'll find something . .. I hope so . You know , -- .. I move to Oklahoma .  -- ... Completely . My son is still flopping around , he -- ... He uh graduated from medical school this year and uh , I mean he's in uh , ... Soho in New York . ... Really . Starting an art .. career , ...    So , .. so you see , I mean , a lot of people , you know , I mean he's gonna paint for a year , and just see whether he can do well enough with that to -- Cause he doesn't want to be a doctor after all ? Well , he couldn't find anything he really wanted to do . You know , I mean he , ... Did he specialize at all ? he --  Well that's what I mean , no , he hasn't specialized yet . But he couldn't find anything that just really , ... pulled him toward it , ... and so he said well , .. ... you know , I guess he got a lot out of always doing art when he was young and , he's gotta scratch that little itch , .. I think , Good for him . and , so he's up there , and he'll give it a year and , .. see what happens . And the same for you , you got -- You got plenty of -- There's .. uh , .. fortunately , ... this day and time I think it allows , ... one to , .. proceed like you're and , you're proceeding , and he's proceeding . And I think it , I think it's the right thing to do . I would've d- -- I would probably do the same thing were I , you know , another generation down the line . You know , although I r- nan , .. I didn't make the wrong decision for me . ... But , ... I'm sure I would have been a lot more . ... Uh , ... uh , ... I guess , diligent in in , working it out beforehand but , in , in my time , you know , you really kinda just -- .. There wasn't too many things to do , you know , and , you- .. too many opportunities , and so you just kinda , chose between a few , and , .. that was it . ... Yeah .    So , ... a little simpler lifestyle in those days . .. Tell me where it hurts . ... Uh , .. still a little bit back here . .. Mmkay . Doesn't feel quite normal .. back there , ... under -- Okay . ... It .. originally hurt -- On the sides , yeah , the sides don't hurt much ? It would -- Not anymore . I think it did at fir- nan Mmkay , at first . great . ... He drew some blood out , .. from here the first time . Yeah , I saw that . You got , a little bit of blood , not too much , that's a good sign too . ... Cause , usually when they're torn bad , they have a lot more blood than that . ... Is that doing anything . .. Nothing bad really . ... Which one hurts more , .. back , ... or forward . ... They're about the same . About the same , There's just this sense of constantly not being quite right . .. Mmkay ? ... Well see , let me show you something over here . ... Watch this one . ... See I'm pushing back now , .. Yeah . .. and I'm pulling forward , and it -- ... You get a little bit of pull , ... coming forward it , .. it .. moves out a little bit , .. and , but when you go back , it kinda , ... tight . ... It's got a good catch to it you know , Mhm . over here , ... we're gonna pull , ... pull it out , ... Wow it doesn't have that same movement . ... It's got a little more .. forward movement , ... and it , .. kinda , ... has a , kind of a rubbery kinda end stop there , .. so uh , chances are , .. you've uh hurt that , ... uh ligament in the back too . Uh , .. The crossband ? .. Mhm yeah . The -- ... Call -- We call em the cruciate ligaments . He calls em the exbands , or whatever they are , Yeah , I don't know what -- th- they -- They cross , ... and one -- .. They cross because one's going forward and one's going backwards , and they keep you from going forwards and backwards , is basically what they do so . Hunh .  Pretty logical arrangement there . Mhm . ... ... Yeah , it is . Your posterior's ... messed up a little bit .  .. Well , can that get better ? ... Uh  , ... mm , ... get a little better maybe . ... It's not gonna get all the way right , ... Mm . It'll be .. a little bit of a problem . I'm not sure you didn't maybe have some of that before , I don't really know , ... uh , .. let me see w- .. how much this hurts here . .. Mm . ... None ? ... Mmmm . Good . ... .. My main physical activity , for the past year and a half has been aikido , ... which is a pretty gentle art . Mm . ... Mmkay . .. Lot of rolling , lot of -- ... The knees do take something from that , I believe that they -- ... A lot of work on em , Oh yeah . Sure . Any of those ... things gotta .. put some kinda .. stress on your leg , you know ? .. I definitely want to get back to it though . ... I had to lay off it for a while . ... That ... hurts right over here . Okay . Mmkay . ... It's not too bad though . ... .. It's just very mild , uh , that -- That one could probably -- ... See look at the difference on here now . what- .. see -- ... See how much of a jiggle you got there , you got just ... a little laxity there . right ? Mhm . .. And this one's just .. a hair different . I mean it -- ... But it hurts . .. A bit . .. Uh , a little bit . .. It hurt a lot at first . But it's just a hair , and uh , .. so , if you just let that one kinda heal , ... you know , which I think it's gonna do , cause you don't even complain much of this over here . You know , when you're doing things , you're thinking more about this back one , and that's the posterior ... exband , if you want to put it .. like that , or posterior cruciate we call it . ... ... Uh , ... seems to be the problem , .. but it's not uh , ... I'm not sure you didn't have a little bit of that problem before . ... It isn't -- ... All these years since the wreck , the .. the leg's never felt , you know , like it , ... it's never been totally normal but , Mhm . Mhm . I just got used to it . Did your knee , did your knee feel like it would -- (GASP) ... Sorr- that hurts a bit .  .. Where did that get you , over here ? Again yeah . Right . Yeah okay . That's okay . .. Did your knee feel like it ... had some play in it , you know , it wasn't real steady , .. I don't remember . ... That being a -- Being a .. complaint while you were doing your martial arts stuff ? (SNIFF) Still hurt a little bit too . I injured the front of the knees when I was dancing for a while , I was dancing with Kristy Hannah here , .. few years ago and , Mhm . .. there were some times I came down on it , and it did some --  ? ... But that was .. impact injury . Yeah . Right . ... Let's see .. how rough that is . Let your knee down . .. Alright now straighten your knee out . .. Yeah , you've got a little -- ... Put your -- Yeah . Put your hand . You feel it ? .. Yeah , .. it's  . But that's pretty typical . How about this one . You got anything over here , I've got a  . no that's pretty slick . Just a little click over there . Yeah . .. ... Alright ? Uh , hold your .. leg real strong there , let me pull on it . And let's see if we got , ... a pretty good muscle there ? ... Is that hurting anything ? Mmmm . Kay . .. Alright , well I- -- I think uhm , ... .. You know I -- I think , .. probably , ... it's mostly posterior cruciate , not so much anterior cruciate , which is good , um , ... the medial collateral ligament , that .. ligament here is just minimally hurt , .. .. uh , I think some of that ... posterior cruciate was probably already r- there , and the reason I'm saying that is , because it really ... doesn't hurt that much when I pull on it . See the -- .. This is the one that pulls on that -- It feels tight though a bit . .. Mhm . ... When I push back , ... I'm pushing on it . ... That's -- .. And and that's not bothering you very much . ... But see this one , ... has been hurt , and when I pull on this one , ... That does hurt . y- it it hurts . So , I mean , you know , I mean , pretty simple , you know , if if they've been hurt , they gonna hurt when you stretch em . you know , so ,  that's why I'm thinking that .. posterior is probably , .. a lot of that's been there , .. you may have hurt it a little bit more , .. you know , .. and y -- So you got this one a little bit , and this one a little bit , Both of em are a little , both of em can probably heal up if you let em , ... and , .. No need for surgery to make it better ? No . Unhunh . ... And uh , ... the , ... the outcome will probably be , ... pretty close to what you had before . In other words ,  I -- I may have lost a bit , but it's not  -- Yeah . I mean , you know , five percent or , .. something . You know what I mean , you know , I don't know . You know , you'll just have to -- .. Try to have to see how it plays out . But it it's gonna be minimal . ... And you can z- -- ... You can overcome that a little bit , by getting your .. muscle .. in better shape . ... There are two things that stabilize your knee . This is your knee brace , the big muscle above your knee is the brace for your knee , that's what holds it together when you're doing things . In fact , you know , all the sports players they -- Their ligaments have been stretched so much and , repaired , and stretched , and repaired , that they -- They're just not much good , and they really .. have to .. compensate with their muscle power , is what they do . They do a lot of leg lifts ?  So right . ... Uh , .. you know just , ... just , .. uh , you can do straight leg lifts , or what we call just those .. little short extensions , just put a .. bolster under behind your leg right here , extend the last twenty to thirty degrees with weight on your leg , like this , do little short extensions with weight , ... Mhm ? and keep working up on the weight , ... Mhm ? ... you wanna b- -- You -- What you wanna do , and you can just do isometrics , you can just .. lock your knee real stiff , and just tighten your muscle , hold it tight as you can for three seconds , and then let it rest for three seconds , and then tight for three seconds , and then rest . And you don't have to move it when you do that . Uh , ... nan all kinda ways . So just whatever the day will al- .. permit , I mean , if you're sitting around , and you got some time to do some ... isometrics , you can do that , and then when you have other time you can do the weights .  But .. keeping this strong will compensate for your ligaments is the .. plan . You know so uh , ... you know , I think , I think you'll find you , you do pretty well . ... Do you think I can go back to ... aikido and stuff ? .. Probably , ... as long as it's not too .. too violent . .. You know it's more form and , shape and , ... stuff or it's , it's not too much contact . It's about -- But no it's , ideally it's about .. blending . ... It's about blending with the attack , it's not about meeting the force with force so , .. Okay , ... There's a lot of rolls . .. Okay , mm , well , I guess if you got good at .. at doing it , you know , where you didn't -- Wasn't getting yourself in awkward positions , and you know , .. getting your knee all twisted up underneath you or something , you know , you could probably handle it okay . ..  ... I think , I think you'll .. you'll be able to see for yourself . ... Because .. once you get your .. muscles strong , you get this thing controlling your knee well , you'll see what kind of knee control you have , it'll be pretty obvious to you whether you you have the type of control ... to do that . ... What do you think the lesson should be from this . I mean , .. -- This is the first time I've ever been on skis . I never did it before my wreck , so , ... I guess the less -- W- one lesson is I'll ... probably shouldn't try skiing anymore , .. .. I None -- He- -- -- ... You know , if it were me personally , that would probably be the lesson I'd learn from it . ... Cause I'm lucky it wasn't worse . When I -- Right . .. It was a pretty bad fall , Right . the -- The incline was about , ... I don't know what grade but , there was a .. turn in the wood- -- It was this was in the woods . Yeah right . And it was cross country ,  Yeah . So I didn't know what I was doing , my girlfriend had taught me , .. I had been skiing for two and a half hours , I was tired , ..  and None we were getting close to getting back , .. and I got .. carried away . She showed me how when you're -- In cross country , when you're about to fall , you just sit down . Oh . Okay . But I didn't do it right . So , there was a turn and then , I -- And the .. skis don't ..  off of course . Oh . I know . And so , ... it stuck , and I kept twisting You -- and the knee took all the torque . Oh .  .. And I didn't know what I'd done . ... I screamed and , she helped me , and I manage to somehow , I don't know -- S- somehow managed to get up and , hobble ... on the ski pole , all the way back to the cabin ,  Oh my God . and then we had to call the uh , s- the ambulance to take us sixty kilometers to Oreille , which is a ski resort . ... Geez . We were in the middle of nowhere . .. Hunh . .. I'm a little -- I I think it's been three weeks now , I -- I was hoping that , you know , you told me or , doctor ith told me that you know , with chronic osteo it could come back from impact , and I was -- And I really hope this is not the time , you know , I've made it .. how many -- Ah that's ... unlikely . .. I've -- I have not spiked any fever or , or seen any signs of , Yeah . .. No it's , ... it looks pretty good . I think I may have gotten lucky . ... Yeah , if it's not hurting up there , the pain would be probably your first warning sign . And you know , If that ever happened . Right . .. You could start .. feeling some  .. change in the .. the status quo , you know ? .. Changes , I still feel -- .. Yeah . It feels .. b .. pretty much like the other leg . I mean , Good . .. That's great . .. Wonderful . Solid . ... Great . ... Well , .. Love it . ... Well I'm glad you didn't hurt yourself , ... it's a .. cheap lesson . Right ? That's right .     2..  ... I'd say so . .. Yeah , I -- I was out -- ... We were out , and the kids were .. skiing , you know , and I was watching em go down , and I was thinking , .. God that would sure be fun . You know ? ... And then s , just barely my common sense .. won out , and I decided not to do it , but you know I've had .. two discs taken out of my back , my neck fused for a bad disc , I don't need to go .. flumpity-bump down the hill . You know , I don't need any of that , so , ... you just have to , have to kind of draw a few lines , Mm . but I came close to , ... It's tempting . to trying it , it's tempting . It's very tempting . It was fun , I can tell you , till I fell -- Oh God . It's -- It's just great . .. You know , but , then I'd have to pay for it for the rest of my life , but I didn't know whether I wanted to do that . Not a fair trade . (COUGH) Not a fair trade . No . I wouldn't do it ,  Ch nan that's bad odds . ... Good to see you . ... Come see me . You know whenever you're in town ? I will . ... And uh , ... let me know what you get into , I'm sure it'll be something fun . .. I hope so . ... I think it will . ... See you . Byebye . Okay . .. Okay ? .. Just .. let us know , ... if you need anything . .. Okay . .. Okay ? .. Yeah . I tell you man , that factory's the pits man , What's new . last night I got into a hassle with James Boyd . .. I'm in the cafeteria , Yeah . and I took a break , .. that was just a little bit too long man . You know . Yeah ,   I can imagine .  half hour break  , ... You stretched a fifteen minute break into a half hour break .     to a half hour . And then he comes into the cafeteria . And I thought he was coming in to chase everybody away . He was after you .  But he's coming after me . .. And he calls me . And I'm walking out the door . Right as he's walking in the other one ? Unhunh ? ...   And he goes , Fred , I wanna talk to you , come here . .. And I go , oh man , what is this about . .. And on my production card . ... Let's see . ... The day before yesterday . .. I did ice cream . .. Right , Balian ? Unhunh .  And you gotta pack those in cases . ...  And , Right . so like , I didn't put that down on my production card . How many cases you packed . I don't know man . ... I packed two pallets . ... You know , ... I don't know how many .. cases that is , Unhunh , but ,  you know , that , .. that shit was heavy man . And like , ... and like , ... I put down on the card , you know , no cases . Because it was lost time . You know , ... you know we , Right . we stripped the sides and everything , Right . Yeah . and like , Y- y- you were teaming up with somebody , there were no cases . or working alone .  None I w- -- uh , Gutierrez was doing the .. same job . But we weren't working together . Oh you're working alone . .. Nyeah , and so , ... he comes and says , well , he goes , I don't know if you've , ... if you've , packed this or not . ... You know . ... On your production card , all it says , you know , is that you did ... three thousand sheets , but you did- -- Two loads . Yeah . ... But you didn't pack it .  So I go , yeah , I go look man , there they are . You could see , there's my name , .. nan ... stamped right on there . I just didn't put it down . ... Oh , well I gotta figure it out . And he goes , and what are you doing in the cafeteria so late . I'm just going , aw man ,  this is the pits man . This is at the bottom of the -- That's the last thing you wanted to hear . Yeah really . .. This fucking mayate . You know , getting on my case . Yeah . ...  ...  Well that's nothing new . It's nothing new  , It's always been like that . it's --  It's par for the course man . ... Right ? ..  Yeah , definitely . ... Ts- why I can't take that , that type of living anymore , even is this , uh , .. career doesn't work out for me , I'll find something that will . Something else . Well you're gonna do real estate maybe , right ? Definitely , I'm -- I got my books and everything , I'll be studying and uh , ... but in a sense , I need uh , ... some type of steady income . ... But , but uh , .. you s- -- Th- the competition man . I mean , .. is it real tough ? Like , .. on the lot ? ... Yeah , it is . There's def- -- And there's guys that've been doing that four or five years , and , And they're real good at it . that are real good at it , and they know how to .. talk to the people , and they know that , .. when somebody's coming in , if they're buying or not . ... Oh , they could tell right away . Yeah but that all comes with time . You know , and , Yeah . .. and they're pretty helpful with me , and uh , ... you know it'll all come in time . Right , I- I figure , ... the more cards I get out , the more people I talk to , n- the more cars I'm gonna sell . Just all comes with time . Once I get my experience , I'll be up there too in the top four salean .  Your parents don't know yet . Hunh . No . They'll know when they come back . .. I -- and I think my dad told me yesterday , they're coming back the fifteenth ? or sixteenth ? Yeah . .. def -- I think s- -- nan It's gonna be the fifteenth , which would be on a Saturday I think . ... ... And I'll be working till nine o'clock . So they'll , they'll be pretty .. happy for me , more or less , because uh , they didn't want me to work in the factory much longer . ... Yeah , I know . My mom doesn't know what to do to get me out . ... But , they didn't take a trip through , Brazil , and Argentina ? I don't know , I don't know they- they , they didn't -- They spent the whole time in Guayaquil ? .. Yeah I think so . They tol- -- My dad told me he was gonna go to uh , Argentina , and Peru , and Colombia , but , ... he only wrote one letter , and and they were in uh , .. No one's called em , y- I mean no one's talked to them ? No .  . He sent postcards to everybody , and a letter but , .. None Yeah . ... Other than that , he hasn't called or told us what's up , and he'll be in here no time . .. Is he staying over at Miguel Juarez's ? .. Yeah , ... Yeah ? ... And uh , the other architect . Is his nephew or something . Pe- -- .. Pedro Cruz . ... Pedro Cruz . Yeah , he's a architect or , I never met him . ... I know Miguel , That's his , I've been to his house a number of time . his nephew . Th- one of his .. brother's sons or something . ... Unhunh . ... ... But uh , they'll come back , they'll be happy to see me here , that I got a new career going , and uh , .. They weren't all heartbroken about , .. you know , .. Jeanie and that ? ... Well they have no idea what's happening right now . They must have been -- They have no idea  , When they left , we were on shaky grounds , but , ... nan you know , they thought it might be able to work out . ... So when they come in , they'll be pretty shocked . .. Yeah . And , and hurt . ... But uh , like I say , things .. will work out f- for the best . What about her folks . ... They're not sorry at all , huh . No uh , in fact I've seen em , I -- I w- I went to church with em , for the last three Sundays . Really ? ... With Jeanie . Wow . ... She thought it might , you know , help our relationship as friends , and uh , ... She still considers you man . Hunh . Exactly . She does , because I mean , we went to church together , for the last three Sundays , .. Yeah .  and then , then we went to the movies after , ... and her her folks were at church , and , you know , n afterwards , her mom , w- had a injury on her leg or something , .. she wasn't at church last Sunday , ... we went to the , to their house . And uh , .. I went over there , and her brother was there , her nephews and nieces , her sister , ... our godson , ... .. And uh , ... you know , it was just like , everybody was real ... friendly and everything , Yeah . ... I don't know if the parents are aware , that we did , you know , Break up ? separate , but it , possibly was for the better , cause they , they didn't feel comfortable with us living together anyhow . Yeah . ... right , that's .. not looked on .. too good .. hunh . No . So , w- what they , what they probably .. think is , you know , that we still have a lot of love for each other ,  That , .. moving out was the best thing , But sh- -- until we both are ready .. for marriage , and if she .. still loves me , and I still love her , and , .. ... we wanna get married , there's still the .. chance of us getting back together , and .. getting married this time . ... Yeah . ...  So I mean it -- I think things are working out pretty good . She called me the other day and uh , ... you know , she calls me and talks to me , and I call her and ask her how her day was and everything . ... Yeah . .. .. What , what does uh , .. your ... sisters say . ... N- they tell me to stay away from her , don't even call or anything . ... Yeah ? Wait till she calls you and everything . But nan , you know , that's not right . ... Yeah . That's hard man . I mean , if she accepts me calling her , and she doesn't tell me , don't call me or ,  They're telling you that , why . To , like uh , Cause they feel that , she's gonna get too strong , by me , you know uh , kissing her ass , Oh . or something or or or , Exactly . crawling back , I see . and begging her , .. you know ,  for me to come back or , She gonna get the upper hand . .. Exactly . Which , which , you know , nan she probably already does . But , ... ... um , Yeah . ... I'm not gonna just .. wait for her to call me , because it's not right , I have feelings for her , I wanna know , you know , how she's doing , doing . I'm gonna communicate with her . That's all there is to it . It's not like I w- -- I'm asking her , you know , ... let me .. move back in or , you know , ... I'm sorry I -- You just -- Yeah . I just wanna remain friends with her , and find out how she's doing . ... Yeah . ... So they , they tell -- I don't tell em I call or nothing . You know , and uh , ... And I sent her flowers last week , I sent her flowers to work . Yeah ? The day before I moved out .  Just to tell her I was sorry about everything that had happened , and that uh , ... you know I hope .. we could remain friends , and that .. God brings us back together , if it was meant to be . ... Yeah . ... And she was real happy about this . She said that really meant a lot to me . You know , That you did send me flowers , and uh , ... And then- -- Then the , and what you wrote . ... Yeah , exactly . Cause she knew it came from my heart , no matter what , .. I'd put her through and everything , she knows deep down inside , I really did love her , but I had a problem or something . .. Yeah . ... You had to get something out of your system . And , Yeah . But I don't even know what it is in fact . I might ... have to go to therapy or something , to find out .   ...  Because there's no -- There's no way I , I should ,  .. you know , ... You should be like this ? Exactly . ...  I mean an- -- People say you ,  you act out of uh , ... it's okay , most men do look at other women , and uh ,  ... you know , things go through their mind and everything , but that I'm impulsive . I'd act on my impulse . .. Yeah . Like I'd see something , I'd want it , and I'd go after her , where I , w- I had a beautiful woman , I shouldn't have ... thought like that at all . ... Yeah . ... This what a lady told me that , that was a therapist . She said she was gonna get me somebody to go talk to and everything . She said it po- -- Ma- -- .. possibily was I was uh , not satisfied with myself . ... I wasn't happy with myself for some reason , and that I just acted out of impulse . .. Yeah . .. Wow . ... So , I don't know . i it is a problem , because I , nan I I did have a nice old lady and um , ... ... Kind of miss her and everything .  It's lonely coming home after putting in t- twelve hours on the lot . And working all day and , you know , working all evening , and then you don't have any- .. NAME? to come home and share it with . ... Yeah . ... Y- are y- -- Are you working twelve hours ? .. You're gonna be , Yeah . You're gonna be doing that ? Yeah . .. Nine to nine ? Definitely . Nine to nine . Well I mean , If I want . .. That's a -- That's up to me , Yeah . Basically , you know , they're gonna give us a shift . Either , nine in the morning , to three in the afternoon , .. or , or th , ... two in the afternoon , to nine in the evening . ... See , Unhunh . .. So if I wanted to come in before two , if I was on the , the evening shift , I would come in at nine , and work nine to nine . ... If I was on the evening shift , from two to nine , I could come in and .. work from nine to nine . .. So , um , ... when you went last week , and you applied right , ... Mhm ? they , they hired you , ... Right on the spot . ... Right on the spot . He gave me interview , he talked to me , told me why I wanted to get into sales , and if , .. if I felt I could sell , if I had any experience , and everything and ,  You told him about all the cars , that you had owned and sold , Yeah , I told him that I had done , .. C- y- sh- you- sh- -- so- sold cars all through my ... early years , but it was 4.. private party . f- uh- you've had- 4.. you -- You've had about , .. like thirty cars ,  At least , hunh . yeah . At least . At least thirty cars . ... So I have some type of experience selling , dealing with people , You know about cars . handling the money , and uh , the only thing it is , th- I have to .. work on , is doing the paperwork . Is uh ,  filling out a contract , and uh , ... basically paperwork , which is f- .. very simple . That , .. you know , once it comes along with experience , and the more people I work with , the easier it will , it'll be , that's the most important thing and , and selling them the car , talking to somebody in , ... to buying a car , that doesn't wanna buy . Tha- that's there to look . ... Yeah . ... But yet , wouldn't mind owning a new car . .. That's right . ... And you've gotta talk em into it , you gotta sell it to em . You know ? You gotta em in your office , ...  .. and you gotta sell that car to em . You can't let em leave without that sale . ... Otherwise , they're gonna go elsewhere . ... Right . ... If they believe you , and you can sell em ,  You need this car , you gonna make a lot of money . you want this car ,  Definetely . take it with you ,  What can I do for you ,  in order for you to buy this car . I mean if , is the price too much ? I could work on the price . Let me go talk to my manager . Maybe I could drop it five six-hundred dollars . Maybe we have a three-hundred rebate that you could use towards the down payment .  W maybe it's it's three point nine financing , that'll save you money in the long run uh , if you finance fifteen or sixteen thousand dollars .  So ,  you know , it's just , it's uh , it's like a game . You know ? .. Yeah . ...  So homes . .. Uh , ... they , .. they put you through training all these days ? Is that it ? Yeah , five days I watched uh , videotapes dealing with this guy that , that , ... nan that sold cars , and made a hundred thous- -- His goal was to make a hundred thousand dollars every year selling cars .  And he accomplished his goal . Every year he sold a hundred thousand dollars , and he retired , Oh my god . at thirty-five after , certain amount of years selling and uh , .. he just got into nan , ... making uh , ... audio cassettes . ... In sales . To motivati- -- Motivation s- .. uh tapes , Oh I see . and uh , A system . .. To sell . Exactly . Books , seminars , um , Yeah .  video tapes . Hundred thousand a year . That guy must've hustled . Yeah , well , it's possible . You figure , you could sell , ... at least twenty cars a month , ... every month for twelve months , you know you're gonna be up there in , f- seventy eighty thousand dollar bracket , ... Twenty cars in a month . .. That's almost a car a day . .. Exactly . ... Which isn't difficult ,  -- If you're on the lot , for a damn ... twelve hours uh , one car , isn't all that much , if .. you have .. the clients coming in . ... That's the only thing . If you have the traffic , Yeah . we're on a busy street , Firestone Boulevard . ... Right . Firestone where , by the six o five ? ... R- exactly . Right before the six o five . Right by -- Yeah . Right past Downy , where we used to play basketball at uh , the YMCA . .. Yeah . .. a- a little ... pa- past that going , I'd say a mile . east . .. Yeah . A mile . A mile going , uh east . .. .. You know , I have been wanting to go visit you . But , I'm afraid you're gonna sell me a car bro .  Yeah well , that's the last thing you need to do , is get in any more debt , than you already are .  2..  Uh , I'm hip man , I gotta get .. outa my debts . Man  , ... Yeah I'm --  And then I'll be a free agent . Man . In fact , I was planning , if they were gonna play basketball , if I did go in Thursday at nine o'clock . ... You could go for .. couple hours , It's right down the street , at least . I could bring my .. work clothes , and uh , sure . Hey you know , take a shower , Take a shower . Why not . Because , like , Get there at seven and , play from seven to quarter to nine , and , take probably five minutes , to get from YMCA to the , Firestone Chrysler . You wanna go tomorrow ? ... I -- I don't know if they're playing , I don't know -- because last week , the gym was closed , they're working on the ceiling . So the last two weeks the gym was clo . Yeah the .. -- .. The last two weeks the gym was closed . And you haven't talked to Gary Holt at all ?  .. I haven't seen him this week . ... Uh , ... I saw him last week , and he told me they were still working on the gym . But I haven't seen him this week . ... Yeah . ... I got a check coming tomorrow , I have to go pick up . So I'll probably be in there in the evening after work . Where , at federal ? .. Yeah . Either at five o'clock , or three o'clock , or , ... we're getting paid tomorrow right ? Yeah ? I got my last , You last what . One week check , and one week vacation check . .. Oh , not too bad . So it'll help me , cause I don't have uh , any steady income now . If I don't sell , I don't make money , I got uh , ... You mean you don't g- -- .. even get minimum ? Well , we get ... six-hundred dollars a month . .. Three-hundred every two weeks . Which isn't bad , I mean I could , No . I could , ..  Now that I don't have to .. pay rent . .. Yeah . I might be able to , ... pay my credit cards , and my car payment , and my insurance , ... with that sixhundred . My car payment's two fiftyeight , the insurance is a hundred a month , that's three fiftyeight ,  .. and maybe about three-hundred in uh , ... credit cards a month .

Could I call right here while -- ... Uh , ... And you could hear me , uh , have the conversation on the phone . Yeah . ...

So I have to have that fixed , in order for me to get , uh , right now , Jeanie's lending me the Samurai . ... Oh she's -- Yeah . She's being real cool . And I've had it for three days and uh , ... that was very nice of her , I appreciated her doing that for me . She's .. taking the Samurai . She's taking her BMW , every day to work . But , she's taking the Samurai . F- ... from you . Yeah . B- because uh , ... I owed her money , because she had an investment in the Porsche with me . ... Oh I see . ... So , ... yeah . ... She gets the Samurai . And you get the Porsche . ... Yeah . And uh , But your dad . Man , he's not gonna like that , too much I don't think . ... Why . ... Cause wasn't he the garante ? ... No , he was the , nan he had the insurance under his name . ... Just the insurance . That's it . So the car- -- The car's uh , ... you know , I'm paying the car and everything and , ... Unhunh . ... But , ... I'm letting her -- she doesn't wanna move the BMW . Right ? She wants to keep it there . No way , that car's ... paid off , it's in excellent condition , and uh , It's a gem . ... ...

I say , better them than me . I know it . ... I know that feeling . Oh . Yigads . .. But they paint- -- That's like anything , they painted the inside the wrong color . We had ordered this -- Well you got it on John . ... Um , Well ,  like an eggshell color . Be- -- Thank you Linda , the color that we had the woodwork in the dining room .  .. Similar to that . That's good . .. Was on their list of colors you could use .  , hm . So that's the color ,  We h- --  .. wanted them to paint the inside trim of the new door they put on . ... The -- ... the h- -- .. Casement and the trim . None COUGH  (COUGH) But they'd brought the wrong color paint , so they painted it white the first day ,  and the guy -- Pat said he came in , he had ... been at unemployment , when he came back , he said , the guy said to him , ... .. POUND oh my God , we painted it the wrong color . I just realized it . .. Don't worry , we'll be back tomorrow . They came back the next day , ... put two more coats of paint on , the right color  . ...   ... Mm . .. Good workers .

They don't do anything for the government , unless it's cost plus . No . ... But when you c- -- I was telling John , ... I just did an ad for The Patriot . ... Yesterday when I was in work . ... Nine-hundred thousand dollars , for thirty-four ... residences . ... In East Boston and Revere . ... So our contract was similar . ... So it's it's an average of fifty thousand . Yeah . You know , between f- ... thirty and fifty thousand . Depending on how much they do in each house . Like some people didn't want the rooms done . ... We figured , our living room was so big , why not take advantage , and have them put new walls , Oh sure . ..  you know ? Might as well get everything .  fifty thousand .  .. Might as well not take everything they're willing to give you . Yeah . That's right . That's that's what we said . Gotta -- so , And also , the ceiling fell down already . So , ... Well , but they didn't do the ceiling , unfortunately , because it's not on a top floor . Are they gonna replace that ? ... No . ... That doesn't ... go ... with ... doing over the room ? The ceiling isn't considered part of the living room ? No . O- no , Only if , ... that room , is on the top level of the house . What did you drop . RING If it's on the top level of the house , they would , because they needed to soundproof it , Al , there's nobody -- .. oh the girls are in there . but there's two levels above . ... So they didn't have to . ... Unfortunately . ... Hunh . ... So what time -- ... I'm curious now . What did they do to the walls ? .. Oh , wait till you see what they did in the living room . When- -- when we get the walls painted and everything , you'll all have to come over . And just see . Oh is the room aller or something now ? Did they -- They went in five inches , on the two outside walls . They put in -- ... they studded ... the outside walls , from the inside . ... You know , the inside of the room . ... Um , ... and then they put insulation , ... and then they put soundproof boards . ... Then they put two layers , of three-quarter-inch ... drywall . ... And then they ... taped it all , and skim coated it . It's beautiful . Oh they skim coated it too , Yep , they didn't just tape it . Yeah , Oh , And then they .. put a ... primer coat of paint on it . So all we have to do is go in and ... paint it . ... They put new woodwork along the bottom , and all new woodwork around the windows . .. Danny and I got crap woodwork . Ev- -- .. All the room- -- ... windows had to have woodwork for them to , ... So , that room out back , that used to be a porch ? ... Mhm ? Danny and I .. put wallboard up , ... and then we got this ... garbage ... trim . ... That was .. on sale for three ninetyfive ? ... They replaced it with the stuff that was thirteen ninetyfive . Mm . Yeah . THUMP Had to put the -- You had to go through the aggravation . None 2.. Of putting it up . Spending the money on this trash , It had to be there , before they would replace -- putting the trim up , ... before they would work on it . Mm . come in and tear it down and replace it . Although , did I tell you that guy that put the hole ? just to get an -- Remember the guy that put the hole , (COUGH) in the back of his house , because he decided he'd like a picture window in his kitchen  ?     And they wouldn't replace it .  They did . Cause there were -- ... Oh they did ?

He probably didn't know himself . .. No . I'm sure he didn't . He went and looked it up in the dictionary ,  so that he could spell it wrong on purpose .  ... (SIGH)   ... Yeah . ... But the windows Al . ... Are ,  Al is oking . This , .. this wide now . ... They're , .. the living room windows . ... It's two .. complete windows . ... They have , ...

Three years ago they put central air conditioning . ... But they stopped that . Because the federal government decided that it was , ...  Extravagant use of money ? Oh man . Cost prohibitive . Too 2..2 bad they -- .. C- oh . .. Oh God , They did it in , .. Too bad you couldn't've got in on that . Connecticut . Connecticut and Rhode Island got the central air conditioning . Ah . But they didn't , .. They -- That's good for about three grand . Yeah . they stopped it by the time , Could you move your house over there 2.. John , they got up here . and have the planes go over , I know . Yeah .    You know actually though ,  you can still hear the planes . We may . ... I was just gonna ask you .

But in the summer , when you have your windows open anyway ? ... Oh yeah . It really doesn't make any difference for her . Well that's why you should've made a case for the air conditioning . That's right . You know I wouldn't have to open my windows . Yeah . I know . 3..  ... But that , that was what the d , .. the guy that came , .. the first day from Mass Port said . boy , unfortunately , ... you're a couple of years too late for the air conditioning  . .. Ah , that would be beautiful .    How much complaining can you do . What did they spend on your house , Oh it had -- probably twenty-f thousand , It has to -- Oh more than that Dan . Thirty thousand ? More . .. More than that . ... Like I said . ... Just give me the money and , Mhm . you can have the house . ... ... We'll start somewhere else . ... It is a really strange regulation though . .. Um , ... did all this work , ... just so they could , ... Come in and tear it down . So that you can't s -- come , tear it down . I know . .. And get in the carpenters' way . But they -- You sign a contract , Really ? that you can't sue them for noise pollution . ... For at least twenty years after the work is completed .

No walls , nothing . ... We put the walls up , They could've just popped them , Yeah . Yeah . They could've just popped the windows out . Without any trouble . Hm . Put the windows back , .. put the new windows in . Yeah . ... They had to come in and tear stuff down . Yeah . ... And of course , .. the stuff that we put up , ... wasn't first quality , because , w why would we spend the money , Yeah , if they're gonna replace it if they crack it , .. so everything they touched , Did they take the woodwork down , We made sure we used stuff that they'd crack . that Danny put in your kitchen ? .. Yes , they put up stuff that was worth three times the money . And they told you to f- -- ... you had to do that . Well , it had to be existing . In order for them to replace it . Oh . We had to finish that whole second-floor room . They had to bring out whatev- -- ... You know , the -- ... It was .. like a tradeoff . .. Ah . What did they do upstairs Lucy . Anything ? ... Um , ... well , in the , you know the r- -- ... There's a room off my bedroom . ... That used to be a porch ? ... That Danny and I put the walls in . Mhm ? ... That Joe built . And then we put a cei- -- You know , it was the r- --  The room that Joe built  . house that Joe built . With everything in sideways .   3.. All the windows were sideways ,         they -- Hunh . We went in , and we just threw up wood , to straighten everything out , and put ... woodwork on . ... They came in and they said , ... while we were working on it , (COUGH) they said , oh well gee , you really need two sheets of sheetrock . .. At least , for insula- -- for soundproof insulation . .. If you don't feel like putting it up , we'll put it up when we come in . So we decided , ... Not to bother . Hey , let them do it . Why bother . Let them deal with it .  2.. Mm . 2.. You know  ? Well we put one ceiling up . Sure . We put one up . But they put the second one . None And they require you have a f -- (SNIFF) and they put the stuff in between . .. You had to have it fini- -- Well you had to have it finished anyway . For them to tear it down , Well then we put , but they were gonna put in the -- we put the baseboard heat . We put electric baseboard heat in . .. Um , because it had to be a heated room . ... But they put all new windows in , and we put up the junk ... woodwork , .. and they put up , That was a -- ... Hm . It was great working in that room , We -- We'd make these measurements . Like , you had to measure ,  ..  You put up a piece of plas ,  ..   plasterboard . You'd have to measure like , ..

You know , but , ... they're mostly , ... well there're some studios , and some onebedrooms , and twobedrooms . And has it always been an apartment house ? .. Yeah . ... BARK .. What- -- What is the real e- .. estate market doing . Is it down now None ?  Well , .. it's down in general . ... In New York . But certain areas , yeah . Certain areas sort of held their value . BARK BARK And what happened would be , rather than have it , ... things .. kinda crashing . S- a- -- .. W- -- .. It would just -- .. Things would be slow to sell . ... But , .. they would ho- -- .. The Village is one of the few areas that held its value . ... Um , .. but , certain things are a drug on the market . BARK .. If you have a .. studio apartment , ... you're stuck with it . ..  For the rest of your life . ... Like herpes . Certainly for the next ten years . And , .. and ,  if you have a onebedroom , .. it has to have something kinda going for it . Or you're gonna be sorta stuck . You could be stuck with it . Um , ... two-bedrooms and .. up ... are , ... are f- -- ... easy to se , easier .. to sell . ... Cause Beth . ...

Real nice Sutton Place . It's nice . One of the hardest hits for ... dropped values . Because it .. had soared so high . Th- .. They -- .. Two things . They had soared really high . That ch- -- And , there was an awful lot -- Because they ... soared so high , that .. area .. had less ... zoning , ... uh , Restrictions . restrictions . And they w- -- .. There was .. uh -- There was a lotta building in the area . .. And so , ... between those two things , that ... market ... was , Lotta new buildings . .. Yeah . ... And the new buildings are , ... I don't like the new buildings . Do you like living in New York ? ... Yeah . I love it . ... We traveled all over . We looked around . We thought , my husband and I stayed out on the road , ... for two years . ... And we went all over the United States , and we d , ... we didn't find any place we liked better . So you went from New Orleans to New York ? ... Yeah . Oh that I did years ago . ... That I did , ... But it's the new . That ... part  . God knows , s- nineteen si- sixty something . .. Sixtythree . ... Thirty years ago . So you've lived in New York all this time ? Mhm ? .. Thirty years . Except , I did take five years off .  ..  Thirty years in New York ?  Yeah . Wow . ... I did take five years off . .. I went to uh , ... Florida , which was a terrible mistake . ... We needed a vacation , and we accidentally moved instead . Oh . .. And then , we realized that , ... Well , The first year we were there , we visited New York six times , and we looked at each other and said  ,  .. God , we certainly do go back up there a lot , what do you think that's about . You know , and we were just getting increasingly bored down there and , you know , .. you- .. get .. occupied .. fixing up a house , and that's kinda fun , and then , Where in Florida were you . ... On the Gulf Coast , Fort Myers Beach . We had a nice house , right on the sea . In -- .. Yeah , Right on the sea . I saw pictures . It was beautiful . ... But the poor house , was in fucking .. Fort Myers Beach .  curbs ,  .. they have ramps on all the curbs for the wheelchairs . .. Yes ,  2.. Right , We had to , ... W- i- the building code , you have to have a ramp ,    But anyway uh , You know , handicap bars on your bathroom . In your bathroom . That's right , ... But uh ,  But , we didn't like it . At all . And so , that's when we said , .. well let's not do anything precipitous , like we did moving down here , before we race back to New York , ... let's look around a little bit . ... So we hit the road . And we stayed out for a couple years , Two years they'd been looking . looking all over . ... for other places . Looking 2.. round , ... Really ? And -- Unhunh ? ... Round the US . ... Wow . .. And we , .. kept finding these nice places . BARK And we'd say , isn't this place nice ? And , ... Larry would say , yes , it's lovely . Look at these beautiful homes . Isn't that nice ? Yes ? Isn't that nice ? Isn't that nice ? ... Yeah , but it's not New York . It's --   You w- -- .. Wow . And so we'd ... drive on . ..

Yeah . .. Cause she just had loaves of bread up on the counter . ... And , I guess they eat a lotta bread . ... And there were like two or three loaves of bread , different kinds , open ,  And , Mhm ? so that's what I wanted to get em , And uh , ... I kept watching the ads , I thought , well I'll see some place that has ... the kind I'm looking for .. for em . ... Cause they've got dark .. cabinets . Hm . Real , .. real dark brown . As opposed to my kinda medium brown ? Hm . ... And so , but all the ones in the paper were showing , the early American , the lighter ... maple type wood . ... Yeah . ..

She was in so much pain , all she could do was curl up in bed all the time , ... Yeah , ... And ,   .. That sounds like those screws things that , the one I was telling you about . Yeah . yeah . Well I don't know , these -- ... I think they called em hinges or something . ... Hm . ... So um , ... Terrifying . ...  I don't .  You know , ..  Well , I very 2.. briefly thought of having my jaw fixed for -- Uh- -- ... See my bottom jaw doesn't come up quite far enough ? .. Yeah . ... And um , ... I tell you -- that's -- .. I'm gonna have to be in a really bi- -- I- I- I'll admit , I've had bad experience . But , I'm not volunteering for anything . ... Uh , .. Surgerywise . Well see , mine would be more for looks than anything else , ... Oh , Darlee it doesn't chang- -- Cause my jaws don't hurt . You're li- -- Your looks are fine . ... Uh , ... Don't ever take a picture of me from the side . I saw ... me .. on television . ... Talking , and they had a side angle . And it looked terrible . ..  Yeah , but you're probably extremely critical too . And everybody else probably wouldn't even , None Yeah None . You know ,    Because this guy , at work ? ... uh , well , they had they had it on the night before . It's back when they had this , San Antonio Housing Authority putting , .. the houses in your neighborhood , and they put three on my street . ... You know , I said hey , if you wanna be fair about it , spread it around the neighborhood , Don't just put em all , They put all three on my street .  And ,  They put what on your street ? MIC Uh , public housing . Oh yeah . They do that a lot in a lotta areas . They're doing that around here too . Yeah but , this is --  Usually it's uh , ... uh p- uh , oh what is it , None None It's on the cords None . uh None , ... Something with a number in it .  hold this  None . Hu- it's not like HUD ?   Yeah that's how they None None That's public housing . There's HUD , and then there's something else . MIC Hm , ...  I don't really know . And uh , ... They check on the stuff and all . At least San Antonio Housing Authority does , ... Well , it's real funny , .. One of the guys is , ... uh family is , and it's uh , .. husband and wife and two kids . ... He works for the city , he works for the city dogcatcher , I don't know how much they make , But , ... like my house , .. damn good thing I bought it when I did , My ... friend up the street , she pays almost five-hundred dollars a month ... house payments , ... this guy gets his for ninety dollars a month . ... Yeah . I mean ,   give the people who aren't making the money .. a break . ... But one fifth ? (COUGH) You know , How much could that ... person be making less than say Danny right now . ... Um , ... Yeah , I don't really know . ...   But , .. So nan , other than it looking kinda tacky , they just got all kinda planters , and all kinda crap piled outside . They don't -- ... They haven't gotten to the point of , ... putting their old water heater out there or anything like that , There's one house , when they started all this , we -- ...  Somebody got a list of the .. houses on this one , ... um , subsidized thing ? Unhunh .   And ,  me , and about five other people , drove around to all these houses , to see what they look like . .. And , ... about half of em were as nice as mine or nicer . S- kept up . ... You know m , Then some of em had better uh ... landscaping . ... But , .. you know like I keep my lawn mowed , and trimmed and all that ? About half of em were .. as good , .. or better than mine . Which -- ... That's fine . ... Yeah . They they -- I thought they were doing a real good job . .. The other half , ... they , long weeds and stuff .. was the least of the the problem . ... This one house had , ... it looked like an abandoned junkyard . .. It had so many old appliances , and broken down shit out in the front yard . I don't know what the- -- .. what the ... thing was . ...  But you find people do that , If they were my neighbors , that- -- .. all all -- I mean , I hate to say it , a lotta times the people in our neighborhood ? That .. do that . .. There's no reason for -- I cannot- -- I don't underst- -- Of course I don't know their finances . Yeah , I mean , you know , right . I'm not into their books , or anything , But I I -- There doesn't appear to be any logical reason for it to me . They're just pack rats ,  Yeah  . or something , I don't know . Yeah , But if -- Hey . If , .. If people had to come to my house , and pass ... one of these houses that look like that , I know , it's depressing . ... I'd call the health department , and tell em it's a health hazard . .. Cause I think it is , ... Yeah . Well , It's gotta breed rats and stuff ?  ... Yeah  . all those little ... spaces they can get into and stuff ? ... Yeah , I gue- I gue- -- probably , It'd be a good place for em to get out of the sun or get out of the cold , ... Yeah . .. That's TRUE . But , ... evidently , that one house , I- I went by it , about a year after that . .. And , .. it was still the same way . ... Worse . .. Worse . Hm . ... Yeah , More things , it gets --  but ,  I don't know . Uh  , I guess , uh , ... I wish I could think of the name of that other ... program . ... See this one guy at the store had a house , that he bought , and then he couldn't afford the house payments anymore , so , he got .. with one of these , ... um , ... support things and , ... uh , ... like HUD , and I can't think of the name of it , ... and they guaranteed him , ... a residence , Section eight are you talking ? ... Section eight . ... Yeah . ... None Yeah None . And , ... it worked out good for him , otherwise he would've lost the house . Eventually he got it back . .. You know , he took it off that and , he got his finances back in order , so he didn't lose his house .  So it worked out good for him on that , and he said , the people that , ... all the people that had rented his house , he said Section eight , ... That uh , Section eight people kept up good with it . And checked on the people . ... But on this other program , ... it didn't look like they did . ... Yeah . .. So , ... anyway . Hunh . ... But  , ... So what did you get -- And now how did we get on that . .. Hunh ? I don't know how we got on that . .. .. I can't understand you . I don't know how we got on that . (COUGH) No , I I don't know -- .. oh I -- We were talking about books . I don't know . ... How we jumped to that . ... Uh ,  But , what was I gonna , oh um , ask you , What'd you get for Christmas .  Oh , some earrings from Brenda and Danny , ... a little Christmas statue from Brenda and Danny , that , .. it's um , ... I don't know , ceramic , or , .. what it's made out of , and it's real cute , it's got a , ... little boy , with a deer , and Santa Claus . And until Brenda pointed it out to me , Hunh . I didn't realize it . It looks like the little .. boy brought the .. deer , to Santa Claus , ... for Santa Claus to fix its -- Had the deer with its .. uh .. leg up , .. and Santa Claus was bandaging it . Aw ,    Oh  .    So ,  That's cute . well and , Yeah . That was real cute , ((KITCHEN_NOISE)  Did uh .. Andy mention anything about the uh cards ,  that .. we got for Christmas ? ... Unhunh . The Christmas cards , .. Oh , why don't I let .. him tell you , because , it was something th , we .. really got struck by it , because it's uh , what is the poet ? Or something ? That did the verse ? ..  That your mom really liked ?  ... What was it ? Oh um , Helen Steiner Rice . Yeah . What- s- s- -- ... Wait a se- -- Helen , Helen Steiner Rice ,  or something like that . None Helen .. Keller Rice . ... Or something like that , anyway , he was .. all excited , so we , ... kinda made sure that we , .. sent em all to you guys . Because we were thinking that maybe one of you might remember that .  .. Yeah . Oh yeah . Helen Steiner Rice . .. Steiner Rice . Steiner Rice . Yeah . .. I had n- -- I had never heard of her . But that doesn't mean much , but uh , they were nice verses . Yeah . I kinda liked her . Mhm , Yeah . ... That , and then , I also got a Christmas card um , ... from , .. one of my friends , that was from uh , ... MD Anderson , .. you know , the children's , .. uh , MD Anderson cancer ... thing , Oh . in Houston ? where they design the cards . ... Oh yeah . So I thought that was nice too , Yeah , that's neat . Yeah . ... Yeah , sounds good . Well listen , I'm gonna pass you back to Andy . .. Okay . Okay . Have a nice Christmas . Y- y'all too . Okay . .. Bye bye . Bye bye . ... Who's there . ... Darlene . .. Yeah . ... ... So you had a good Ch- -- So she said you wanted to tell me about that Christmas card . ... Hunh ? ... She said you wanted to tell me about that Helen Steiner R- -- Well I was gonna tell you about it , but she beat me to it .  Well it was Helen Steiner Rice . Yeah , that's the one mother liked . ... I know . That's -- When we saw that , I just grabbed the whole box . ...   ... Yeah ,  .. ... Okay , the next case will be uh , Walter Komak versus Rose Black ? ... Is this contested ? No , Just witnesses and case . No . .. Oh okay . Are you  -- Are you the uh ... plaintiff ? Yes . .. No . I'm the defendant . ... Oh . But I'm the plaintiff , .. on the countersuit . ...  . Oh . ... Let me have this pen for a minute . Oh . ... (COUGH)  that's never worked . ... Yeah . Sign here ? Yes . ... Okay now this is a case that a v- -- originally was filed by Walter Komak , who is now present , not present , ... against Rose Black , ... um , ... asking for a security deposit , ... and since he's not here , ... uh , we will not rule in favor of him , ... and then there was a cross complaint , ... defendant's claim , ... uh , ... by uh .. Rose Black , ... for five-hundred and thirty-three dollars , ... balance of rent due , at the end of the lease . ... And Miss Black , I presume you're the landlord . Is that correct ? Yes . .. Mhm . And was there a uh written agreement , or a uh lease ? Yes . ... Was it a l- -- uh month to month , or a uh , A year . .. A one-year lease . One year lease . Let me see that please . ... Okay . So now , uh , how do you arrive at the five thirtythree , you say that they , that Mister Komak owes you . ... Uh this was the , ... um , breakdown of the security deposit . Let me see that please . ... So there was original security deposit of eighteen-hundred and seventy-five dollars , That's correct . ... And then you did some repairs on uh , reinstalling screens ? Right . ... Okay . How come they were -- it was necessary to do that ? ... They had removed the screens . Okay . .. Alright . ... And then um , .. they owed some rent . They were behind in their rent ? ... Uh , they were not behind in the rent , .. the -- .. The lease was terminated , because of their behavior . .. They ... broke .. uh s- one of the conditions of the lease , which was not to disturb the other tenants there . .. Okay , So I had to give them a three-day notice .. to leave . ... T- uh , three-day notice .. to -- Quit . ... Well I know , but , normally you would give em three-day notice to perform uh ,  ... Okay , One of the covenants , such as uh ,  keep quiet .  .. They were not able to be quiet . ... Um what ha- -- Okay , so then they -- ... So then they left within that three days ? ... No . They left a month later . .. At the end of June . ... They paid the rent for June , ... Okay , and they left , uh July first . And there were two months .. left .. of the lease . D- --  And rent's uh , thousand uh , .. two-hundred -- Twelve seventyfive . five . Okay . Mhm . ... Now , um , ... did you rerent the -- rerent the premises . Yes I did . As of August twentyeighth . ... So it reduced , uh , that seven-hundred three , to five thirtythree . ... Uh , seven thirtythr , I'm not sure wh- where the seven thirty-three comes in . Seven o three was the balance that they owed me , Seven o three . ... after they moved out . Right . But there's a credit , because they m- -- you got -- That's correct . Okay . So you're giving a three-day uh ... credit , and how much is the daily rent ? Mm , ... It was forty-two fifty . .. Okay . So , how much do you say they now owe you ? ... Five-hundred and thirty-three dollar . And I don't -- and that's what you put down on your cross complaint . That's correct . I see . 2.. Mhm . Okay . ... Well that seems uh , ... fundamentally fair , and they're not disputing it , so I will grant you your request . .. And I will hand back your documents . Thank you very much . ... And how do I get them to pay . ..  None None Go to the all claims court office , they have some paper work , ... None Thank you None .  ... There's a all-claims advisor that you can ask . Thank you . ... Okay , the next case will be uh , Mitchell Roberts , versus uh Matthew Collins , ABC Builders Interiors ? ... This -- both sides are here ? ... Is this contested ? ...  ... Who's Mitchell Roberts . Right here . .. Okay . ... Sit on this side here . ...  ... Sure . ... Who's the .. party being s- ... served . .. You are ? ... Thank you . .. Nice pen . Alright . ... Okay , let's see , who's here now . Mister Roberts ? ... Right here . ... And you brought an action , .. against uh Matthew Collins , for um , ... roughly seven-hundred dollars , ... for labor installing a carpet . T- uh , ... during last uh August to September , ... okay , and uh , .. just tell me about how you arrived at uh this claim . ... Uh I was called by ... Matthew here , ... to do the job for him . So I went out and looked at the job , .. Okay , you run a -- you run a .. a carpet business I presume ? Yes . I'm a licensed contractor . Okay . ... Um , the job was out at UCSB , ... I went and estimated the job for myself , to see if I could take the job , ... for what he wanted to pay for it , ... and I let him know that I could not . ... Do the job . ... I wouldn't make any money . ... So uh , ... upon me .. telling him that , ... he offered , ... to pay ... my employees , ... fill out , he had em fill out double-u two forms all of em , ... and he paid him , to lessen the burden of payment on me , ... so that I in turn would make more money off the job . ... I agreed to that , ... after about -- ... Ca- .. is that a normal procedure  , Not at all . ... He wanted me to do the job , ... so he offered to take some of the monitory burden off my back , ... so that I could do it for the agreed amounts that we were gonna do it on . .. So in other words , your -- your helpers would really be his employees for the purpose of this job , That's correct . He had em all fill out the plo- proper forms . ... So then your costs would be reduced there as far as , .. That's correct . Alright . ... Uh , ... I went to receive my check , ... of which , ... we had agreed , .. that he would deduct , ... the amount ... of .. the hourly wage , ... that he was -- Was this agreement in writing , or verbal . ... Completely verbal . I've been working with him for like six years . ... Uh , .. upon a reve- uh -- uh ... receiving my check , ... uh , ... for about ... two and a half weeks of work , ... approximately between fifty and seventy hours , I was paid three-hundred and sixteen dollars and fifty-one cents . ... So I approached him with it , ... and he handed me this yellow piece of paper here , ... and noted that , ... what the employees made , ... and uh , ... at twenty-six percent less deduction on these two employees . ... Which was the employer contribution . ... So I noted to him that he was supposed to pay that , ... he said , uh n , ... no , ... you're gonna pay it . ... So I said that's not ... as per our agreement , he said yes it is , he handed me my check , rolled up his window , and drove off . ... And he's there to state , .. he's -- ... he saw that , and was .. witness to that . ... I have a letter , I don- I don't think it's relevant that he rolled up his window and drove off  . Well , I know . .. But , ... that- -- that was the end of our thing , I tried to contact him everything , ... finally I uh .. contacted my attorney , ... I'd like to present this letter to you here . ... Okay . If I may look at that . And , .. have you shown that to uh Mister Collins ? Yes please . Yes . He has -- .. he has ... received ... a copy of that letter . ... ... Now Stu Roberts is an attorney . Is that correct ? .. Yes sir , ... You're uh , ... I'm his nephew . You're his nephew . ... And you're Nick Ro- .. Roberts' nephew too then . ... That's correct , .. Okay . ... So uh your uncle then wrote uh Builders uh a letter , that's what I'm reading now , ... Yes sir , ... Uh I do emphasize that I'm reading it , this is not evidence , this is only y- your story , that you've told ... Mister Roberts , That's correct , ... That's correct , Okay . ... So really the dispute then boils down to this twenty-six percent . .. That's it sir . ... Okay . ... That's the reason why I had him ... fill out that portion of , or he ... wanted to ... write those checks . .. Was so I would save that money , so I would do that job . ... Okay . At the end of the job . .. Mister Collins I know you're , ... biting at the bit there , you wanna say something , so why don't you go ahead . .. Okay thank you your honor . ... Um , ... uh pretty much , .. um , ... what Mitchell has stated is untrue . ... Mitchell , ... uh did do some work for me out at the college , we did the Anacapa Residential Hall . ... And this is a , ... eight-thousand-yard job , .. that we did this summer . ... It required us to , ... employ , ... oh five or six crews , ... uh Mitchell Roberts was one of them that we used , on the job , ... Uh Mitchell ... expressed a desire to do the work out there , ... he expressed , ... he did not know how to handle the payroll . ... Most of the ... uh contractors here in town , that are independents like Mitchell , ... don't know how to do prevailing wage statements .  .. The college is a ... state-funded uh ... uh ... remodel , ... and on state-funded remodels , we're required , ... to pay prevailing wages . ... Uh prevailing wages , .. that , ... um , ... that indicate different ... levels of agility , ... of the different men working . ... And so , .. uh a lot of the crews , ... uh , ... like Mitchell , .. who have .. people that work ... under him , .. around town , in .. regular situations , ... come to the people like me , and ask us to do payroll for them . ... When we do the payroll for them , ... we state to them up front , ... that ... uh , we will pay the payroll , ... we will make the deductions , ... and then .. the employer contribution , ... which is approximately twenty-six percent , ... over and above .... the hourly wage , ... is also deducted , ... from .. the .. um ... subcontractor's check . .. Now this uh .. th- twenty-six percent , that'd be .. be social security , and what else would it include . ... Um , .. Sorta like um , ... That's anything above that . Well you have -- You have , ...  ... you have that -- ... I have a breakdown here , of what we paid Mitchell's men .  if you'd like to see that . ... Okay . ... I mean , do -- yeah , y- you got a total of uh , ... seven point six five percent employer contributions on the , ... Um , ... that explains it pretty well , there's quite a few deductions , .. of course- -- ...  , Oh and and the oh the -- the f- -- the annual unemployment insurance , and uh , Right . Okay . worker's compensation , Right . FUDA .. FICA , et cetera . ... Now that's , ... um , ... in any payroll deduction situation , you have , ... the employee contribution , ... which is deducted from the employee's ... wages , gross wages , .. and then you have the employer's ... contribution , which is over and above that .  ... Which the employer has to pay . ... Now the agreement that we had made , ... with all of the ... um , ... subcontractors , uh , ... Mark Preston's sitting here , ... which is testifying for Mitch Roberts , ... also did work for me , ... and he was treated the same way . We .. paid him , ... we took his deductions out , ... as well as ... that , ... and , so we , uh did that , ... with everybody . ... Okay wai- -- I wanna make sure now . That would be fine if that was the agreement . Now you say that the w- -- you under- -- you explained that to Mister Roberts ? ... Uh yes sir . .. Before he went to work . .. Okay . Mister Roberts , did you have any conversations , ... Absolutely not . with Matthew Collins about that . ... The reason , ... and I stress this . And I don't like to waste the court's time . ... But , ... my ... total , I agree -- If whatever he just said right there was TRUE , with ... withholding and everything . Right I'm -- ... That was fine . ... It really boils down , But -- what- what was the discussion the agreement regarding this , ... The discussion ,  The agreement would be , that he would pay everything . ... So that I wouldn't -- Did he say everything . Y- everything . ... So that I wouldn't end up making , after fifty hou- fifty hours work , which I knew I was gonna make , when I had to play my em- part of an employer contribution , ... I have my own payroll service . They do all that for me , and they're very familiar with all ... types of pay . ... This is why I didn't wanna take the job to begin with . ... Uh I can u- -- He in turn -- I can appreciate that . .. now , Okay , .. Mister Collins says , ... he denies that you said , ... everything . Right ? He just -- I wouldn't've -- I wouldn't've done it . Well , ... You have a different .. story , on what .. the agreement was . .. Right . ... Um , .. uh Karen here , ... uh , does all the payroll , and .. uh , ... she's here to testify about a conversation , ... that .. her and Mitchell had , in our office , about this very thing , and I'd like to -- Before or after the agreement was entered into . .. After the agreement was entered into , ... he had been on the job for about a week or so , ... and , it was time , ... I believe for the , ... first or second pay ... period for his men , ... Uh he came into the office , and had a conversation with Karen , ... about , ... A the payroll , ... and B this twenty-six percent that we're talking about . And she'd be happy to tell you -- Okay ma'am , .. why don't you please , .. explain the conversation you had with Mister Roberts . ... Okay . Um , he was -- ... we were going over the wages for Phil Nigel , .. who was one of the .. gentlemen on there , ... as to .. how much .. Phil was to get , ... for the job . .. On an hourly basis . ... And , he had mentioned to me , that he was wanting him to get ex amount , and I said okay , if it's ex amount to Phil , then , plus twenty-six percent means , I take out ... this amount , ... from your check . ... And he goes oh . Well then .. no , I don't wanna have the , you know , take out that much . So we were going back and forth with the figures , and so finally , ... this is .. the , ... uh , ... wage that we came up with , which was thirteen fifty to Phil ,  ... And then have seventeen dollars .. an hour , taken out of Mitch ... 's check . ... Mitch Roberts' check . ... And this is the note that I'd written down on that . And then , ... you can see that thirteen fifty plus twenty-six percent , which is three fiftyone , would actually equal to seventeen o one , and I said , Why don't you show him the note . .. You know , ... just the seventeen was fine . Oh this -- ... So , d- did you have that conversation . I don't -- ... I had that perfect conversation with her . .. And that's very TRUE , exactly what you said . ... But she never told me anything about , ... this twenty-six percent , that was coming a- come out of my check . ... Why- -- .. It's -- ... go ahead . ... I was offered , Matthew offered me , I'm Mark Preston , I'm a licensed contractor also , and Matthew offered me the same ... situation . ... And it was my understanding , ... that he was to pay ... everything . Supply the glue , ... supply -- and take care of my guys , and make the payroll , .. and pay all of the employer's stuff . ... If you're an employer , you gotta pay the stuff . .. You gotta pay all the extra things . But , you don't have any -- ... y- you can't testify , (COUGH) unless I'm wrong , about the conversation those two had . You weren't there . Is that correct ? I know for a fact that , ... Mitch was mak- -- He was not there . M- and- -- he just mentioned that he -- Matthew just mentioned that he deducted the same out of my check ? ... He did not . I worked strictly by the yard , and I paid my people . .. Prevailing wages . Well any agreement he had with you is not relevant to the agreement he had with Mister Roberts . Well , nan I saw the people's checks , ... and , ... I'm just drawing a pi , verify what Mitch said . ... H- Ma- Mister Collins was supposed to pay ... everything . ... He approached him with the same , Fir- f- f- -- with the exact same thing , And he d- -- Jerry Stillman he did the same thing , he did the same thing with Marco Villaremo . ... Who're all licensed contractors . ... But I still -- I still don't know --  that may have been on other cases , the question is , did he do it in this case . .. He -- .. it would be , ... if it may please you , ... uh , .. the whole reason why I'm here . ... Is because he took that twenty-six percent out , that he told me he wasn't gonna take , ... he used it as , .. more or less bait me to do the job , ... and went ahead and withheld it from me . ... Without saying a word to it , I had nothing , .. I was expecting to make about a thousand dollars on the job , I understand that . ... And , .. when he wrote my check . ... He wrote my check to me , ... handed it to me through a window , ... says that's the way it is , ... and th- -- and and you know -- it wasn't -- and- he totally evaded me , .. he has to this day evaded me , .. Mister Roberts . .. That's beside the point . What I'm trying to -- ... We have to really hone in on , what was the agreement . Not how he paid you , The agreement was , If he -- .. That , .. You know , I don't care if he folded an airplane and ma- -- and sailed it through the air , He would pay all my employees . That was the agreement . ... Everything . But he di- -- he disputes that . ... Well , I understand that . That's why we're here your honor . .. Okay . ... But , you're the plaintiff . You have the burden of proving your case . That's the problem I have is , ... you've gotta convince me by a preponderance of evidence , that what you're saying is TRUE . ... Well then if -- More- -- more likely than not . .. Now you say one thing , and he says another , ... Then -- when- when a person .. fills out , or has other employees fill out the double-u two forms and everything , ... why would I become liable , ... for that contribution . When h- .. when he in fact by law , is now employing those employees . ... He's the employer . ... I am doing nothing . ... Isn't there a law that states that fact ? ... When you have , ... uh people , ... work for you , and fill out specific forms to the state , ... stating that ? Tell me again . Wh- -- what were the -- what was the agreement again ? Go- go through the -- .. y- conversation as you saw it . ... Conversation was , Mitch , if you do this job , ... I'll go ahead and pay all your employees , and you in turn will be able to pa- make more money . ... That was pretty much it . ... That's it . ... That's to the point , Oh so he in effect said , And that's it . I will pay your employees . That's correct . ... And he did sir . ... And then when it came to the employer contribution , ... without my knowledge or anything , until I received this check , ... he just yanked that right out of my check . ... And Mister Collins nan , ... that conv- -- tell me about the conversation .. you believe .. happened , ... Well , ... um , ... Mitch and I , .. um , Mitch had come to me and said he would do the work out there , ... but he wanted to do the work under the basis that I paid his men , ... and I told him about , ... what I said earlier here , .. About the twenty-six percent ? Yes , That was mentioned to him . Always . Oh yes . Uh , always , it was mentioned with Karen here , on her note of nine two ninetythree , that she wrote down her note that she talked with him , Twelve fourteen . ... and .. at .. uh , at every juncture . ... He was -- ... uh made aware of , ... the uh , the contributions , ... were made by the employer . These were his men , .. and we were doing a service for him , ... under this agreement that we had between us . .. Now just -- just seems from a logical standpoint , I wasn't there obviously , it seems like if you had said that to him , he would've said wait a minute , it's not worth it to me . ... That's correct . Would you -- Would you think he would say that . Yes , I would think he would . ... Why would he do the work . Okay . ... So you would trick me into doing it . ... Tho- -- Well not if he , not if he said to you , No , but 3.. then ,  3..  Then , with all my -- .. with my .. fourteen years experience . Why would I do that amount .. amount of work , and knowingly for over fifty hours of work , ... Well I  -- know I was gonna take him three hundred and sixteen dollars to do it . That may be a like a buyer's remorse , so I -- uh I don't -- Well that's not -- I have fourteen years experience in the trade . That's why I turned the d- .. the job down to begin with . Without doing any work at all . ... Well , I'll tell you . if Mister Roberts' testimony is correct he should win , and Mister Collins' testimony is correct then he should prevail . And I agree with you . ... Now- -- But the fact remains , that I would not have done the work , .. for this amount of money . ... That's why I turned the job down to begin with . ... That's why I'm here in the court today , to make .. the court decide . ... It shouldn't -- .. It shouldn't be legal for guys to do this . Well I'm gonna make -- .. None -- I'm gonna make , uh , in my mind , a bad decision today . ... Now , you both seem very truthful and honest . ... I wasn't there . ... But , I'm the one that's bearing the burden of this .. monetary amount . you have to bear the burden proving it , but , ... I understand that . I'm gonna award , um , ... Mister Roberts , ... three-hundred fifty dollars . ... Approximately half . ... Now Mister Collins may not like that . ... now y- -- .. if he doesn't like it , then he can go ahead appeal it across the street superior court . ... Running the risk that he might face , ... the full amount of seven-hundred and four dollars . I will appeal . ... Okay . ... But I'm going to get it -- and award mister Roberts , three-hundred and fifty dollars , ... and if neither party is happy , maybe there's an old saying in court that , .. both parties are unhappy , the judge made a good decision . ... So , ... Thank you your honor . Make it for the uh , ... plaintiff of threefifty , There's some , And I will allow the court costs of twenty dollars and thirty cents . I think there's some papers up there . ... Thank you your honor .  . ... Um , ... any of you who find that you really enjoy storytelling , I would like to mention , that the last weekend in July . In Spring Grove Illinois , there is a festival , children under twelve are free , I'll just mention that to all you parents ,  Um , and it's called the Illinois storytelling festival , ... Have any of you ever gone ? ... I know you have . ... Alright . ((LAUGHTER) Put your hand down . Uh -- When I found out I was telling here , I didn't realize , that Dusty , had attended your church a number of times , he's also a storyteller , .. uh , .. from the .. Illinois storytelling festival .  And uh , .. we would love to have you all come . .. There are four tents , a children's tent , an adult tent , a general tent , and then a .. traditions tent . Where everyone can come and just , share their memories of growing up , or , world war whatever , or , .. f- first time you ever rode in a train , .. all of those things , it's a wonderful family event . .. And I hope that some of you would be able to come . ... COUGH ... The next story that I have , is from , .. the Native Americans . ... It's called how the stars got in the sky . ... Did you ever wonder how the stars got in the sky ? ... This is the way the Indians think that the stars got in the sky . ... And I learned this story , from , ... a white man , who had been adopted into a tribe in Michigan . In .. Wisconsin , ... he has .. taken on all of the Native American ways . And the people thought so much of him , that they have given him , ... uh , also a Native American name . ... And he gave me permission to tell the story . ... Long ago , ... in the sky there was only the sun and the moon . ... And on the nights , .. when the moon didn't shine , it was very dark . Indeed . ... Well all of the animals got together , and decided they were going to go to the creator . ... To see if he could help with the problem . ... Well , when they arrived , the creator said , ... I will help you , but first you must do something . ... All of you are to go down to the lake . .. And gather stones . ... Now not round stones , like the moon , ... but jagged stones . ... And when you have got as many as you can carry , bring them to me , and then I will help you . ... And so , ... all the animals went .. to the lake . ... All except .. coyote . ... Because coyote was lazy None . (COUGH) COUGH And he was .. asleep . ... So , all the animals gathered as many stones as they could carry , the large animals had a great many stones . ... And the little animals like grasshopper and bumblebee , ... they could only carry one . None COUGH ... But they all brought them to the feet of the creator . ... All except .. coyote . Because , ... he was lazy and , COUGH he was ... asleep . ... So the creator looked over all the stones that were brought , .. and chose one . .. Not too large ,  ... and reached up , ... and placed it in the sky . ... And when he did , .. it began to twinkle . ... And he said , ... this I will call a star . ... And this one a special star . A homing star . ... The North Star . ... And this evening , all of you animals , .. are going to go , ... off the edge of the Earth , ... into the sky , to make your pictures . ... With stars . ... And so , ... that evening , ... all of the animals , gathered their stones , ... and they walked off the edge of the world . ... Into the sky . ... To make their pictures . With the brilliant dots , ... that would turn into stars . ... They all went except ... coyote . ... Because he was lazy . ... And he was ... asleep . ... Well after all the animals had gone , ..  the creator called to coyote . None COUGH He said , Coyote , ... come on now , get up . ... Time- -- Enough of this being lazy , come on over here , I have a job for you . ... And coyote , ... he yawned and , ... he got up , and he ... dragged himself to the presence of the creator , ... and said ye- yes , what , ... what ... do you need me to do . ... And the creator said , well all of the animals have gone off the edge of the Earth , to make pictures in the sky . But some of them can't carry very many stones . ... I want you to take this , (COUGH) ... this great big bag of stones into the sky , and when any of the other animals need them , ... then you give them the extras that they need . ... .. Well , coyote was lazy . ... And he took one look at that bag and thought , hoh , ... I don't wanna do that . ... But you don't argue with the creator ,  ... And so , he said he would . And he , .. got up and he , .. took that heavy bag and , ... put it on his back and , he walked off ... the edge of the Earth .  ... Into the sky . ... Well he hadn't gone very far ,  when that bag started to feel .. very .. heavy . ... And so he looked one way , .. .. and then he looked the other , ... and he put that big bag down , ... and then he dug both paws in , and threw a whole bunch of stones behind him one way , and a whole bunch the other way , ...  and of course , as soon as they hit the sky , they all began to twinkle behind him .  ... and then he picked that bag up , ... put it on his back again . ... Well it wasn't so heavy now . ... So he walked a little further , ... and a little further , but that bag began to feel heavy again . (SNEEZE) ... And he looked one way . (COUGH) ... And he looked the other way . ... And then he put that bag down , ... and he dug in again . ... Flung one paw full of stones one way , one the other way , ... and no one had seen him . ... But the sky was getting brighter behind him . .. He put that bag right up back on his back , (COUGH) ... walked a little further . ... Well it felt good for about a minute or two , and then lazy coyote , ... he just couldn't stand it anymore . ... He looked one way , ... he looked the other , ... then he put that bag down , .. opened it real wide , ... and like a puppy .. digging a hole , .. he just dug , all of those stones , right out of that bag , until he got right down to the bottom . ... And all those stones , started sparkling behind him . ... Then he took that bag , ... made sure it was empty , .. folded it up , ... made a little pillow , .. pulled up a comfortable cloud , ... laid down , ... and went to sleep . ... Well , pretty soon the animals were running out of stones , they started calling . .. coyote , we need some more stones over here , ... right over -- where are you coyote ? ... Well ,  .. coyote didn't hear them . ... Because he was lazy , ... and he was , ... asleep . ... Well , ... the first rays of morning , started peeking over the edge of the Earth , and all the animals had to scurry ... back onto the Earth . Before day broke . ... Some of them had to leave their pictures , ... half done . ... Some had only had one stone . .. They could just ... put up in the sky . A few were finished , like the swan , ... and finally when a ray of light hit coyote in the eye , ... he woke up and , .. he realized , he too had to hurry back onto Earth . ... So he did . ... But that night , ... when he looked up at the sky , ... that's when he learned how to howl . ... Because he saw all the other animals with their pictures in the sky , ... and his wasn't there . ... Because he'd been lazy . ... And he had been .. asleep . ... And that's the story , ... of how all the stars got in the sky . ... APPLAUSE ...  Well . ... .. Some of my favorite kinds of stories , are stories where the audience gets to help a little bit . ... ... And this is a story that has a tiger . (COUGH) ... And I need you to be the tiger . ... Now this tiger keeps changing his mind about things , sometimes you're going to say , ... that's good said tiger . Can I hear you say that ? ... That's good said tiger . That's good said tiger .  And sometimes , ... that tiger changes his mind . ... And he says , ... that's bad said tiger . ... That's bad says tiger . Alright . Well let's see , what keeps flipping this tiger back and forth . Shall we ? ... Boy was sitting on a big rock . In the middle of the jungle . ... Just sitting . ... When along ... came ... tiger . ... Run boy . ... Said tiger . .. Run . And then , ... I will .. chase you . ... And I will ... catch you . .. .. And then , hmhmhmhm . I will eat you . So run ... said tiger . ... Well ... said boy , ... Eat me then . I have no run left in me . ... What ? ... You won't run ? ... Tell me why you won't run . and then I will eat you . ... Said tiger . ... Well it's like this said the boy . ... I was walking . ... Just walking in the jungle when , .. ... I bumped into rhino . ... You know what a rhino is , don't you ? ... A great ... big .. animal with a horn . None COUGH ... Or rhino bumped into me . ... I was willing to forget it . ... But not rhino . ... So he got mad , and I ran away from there fast . ... Now this is where you say , ... that's good said tiger . ... That's good said tiger . That's good said tiger . ... Well I ran , and I ran and I ran and I ran , ... but all the while , there was rhino . Running .. right .. after me . He can't see very well but , .. boy can he run fast . ... That's bad said tiger . That's bad said tiger . Well I ran and I ran and I ran and I ran , until I found a low tree . ... And I climbed up in that tree , and I sat on a branch , ... and rhino , he ran right under me , and he kept right on going . ... That's good said tiger . That's good said tiger . ... But , ... he came back .. looking for me . ... That's bad said tiger . That's bad said tiger . ... So I got down , and I picked up a stone , and I threw it at rhino to scare him away , ... That's good said tiger . That's good said tiger . ... But , .. it didn't scare him away . .. That's bad said tiger . That's bad said tiger . So I got down , and I ran a little more . ... A little slower now , because I was so tired but , .. at least rhino was getting tired too . ... That's good said tiger . That's good said tiger . ... And then , ... then , I was running , and I tripped , into a shallow ditch , ... right in front of rhino . ... That's bad said tiger . That's bad said tiger . Yes . Well , but rhino was going so fast this time , .. he ran right over me . ... That's good said tiger . That's good said tiger . .. But I got up , ... and , ... there was rhino . Right there ... back again . ... That's bad said tiger . That's bad said tiger . .. So I ran and I ran , until I saw .. a vine . and I grabbed the vine , and I swung across the river , to the other side . ... That's good said tiger . That's good said tiger ... But on the other side , ... was crocodile . ... With his mouth .. wide open . ... That's bad said tiger . That's bad said tiger . So I swang back , and I let go of the vine , and I landed with a thump , ... and I didn't see rhino anywhere . ... That's good said tiger . That's good said tiger . So I got down , ... and then I realized , ... I had been ... on .. rhino's .. back . ...  Tha- -- Tha- -- That's bad said tiger . That's bad said tiger .  ... So I got behind a tree . And I picked up another stone , and I threw it just as far as I could , rhino can't see very well , but he heard that stone , and he ran off after it . ... That's good said tiger . That's good said tiger . ... And then tiger said , .. And so then , you .. ran away ? And you got away from rhino ? ... And boy said , ... well .. No , ... I .. was so tired , I .. just sat down ... here , and , ... and , and now I'm going to get behind this big stone , because , .. here comes rhino now None . rhino . ((LAUGHTER) That's bad said tiger . That's bad said tiger . And he took off running fast . And the little boy , got up , .. not tired anymore , and he ran away home , as fast as his little brown legs would carry him . .. And that's good , ... that's bad , is the name of that story . APPLAUSE ... Now I know storytelling is a new thing for a lot of you , but it -- ... Um , .. if you do have enjoyment of it , I hope you will join us another time , at .. at the storytelling festival . ... I have one more story for you , ... And -- (COUGH) ... How many of you already know the story the frog prince . ... The frog prince , ... the prince who is , ... turned into a frog by a witch , and , and then , in order to ,   Is it reminding you of someone you know ? ((LAUGHTER) I h- -- Um , (COUGH) and then in order to .. regain his form , he has to , ... be kissed by a beautiful princess . You've all heard that story I'm sure . .. Well , COUGH this is the story .. of the other ... frog ... prince .  ... ... It was a beautiful day at the pond . ... But the frog prince , ... who was sitting ... on his lily pad in the middle of the pond , huh , ... was he lonely . ... I mean the birds were flying above him , ... the fish were swimming below him , ... but no one was paying a bit of attention to him . ... When , ... who should he see , ... walking along the path with a book under her arm , ... but the most beautiful princess he had ever seen . ... Well uh , ... finally a little company . ... He said to himself . ... ... And he took off his little gold crown , ... put it next to him on the lily pad , ... hopped into the water , and swam across , .. poking his little head up .. through the reeds . ... Oh uh , ... pardon me . .. Beautiful princess , ... he said in his most pitiful .. and pathetic voice . ... But uh ,  I was wondering if , .. if you could help me . ... Well , the princess was quite surprised to be spoken to by .. a frog , ... but she felt so sorry for his pitiful ... and pathetic voice , ... that she said , ... Why , ... you dear little frog . ... Whatever can I can I do to help you . ... And he said , ... Oh , ... well you see ,  ... I am not really a frog . ... .. I am really a handsome prince . ... Who has been turned into a frog by , the spell of a wicked witch . ... And in order to break the spell , ... I must be kissed , by , ... a beautiful princess . ... Well , .. somehow the princess , .. had the feeling that he was gonna say that . but she looked down at him , and felt ... so sorry for him , ... and she thought , ... Well . ... What do I have to lose . ... And so , ... she reached down . ... And she picked him up , ... and she brought him right up close to her face . ... and she closed her eyes , (COUGH) and she gave him , ... a great .. big .. kiss . ... Do you wanna help me make kiss sounds , ... Okay , here we go . ... KISS KISS ... But when she opened her eyes ? ... She was surprised to see , ... the frog , still sitting there . ... ... With a great big ile . On his face . ((LAUGHTER) ... And he said , ... nice kiss sweetie . .. I was just kidding about the prince part . ((LAUGHTER) Ta ta . ... and he hopped into the water . ((LAUGHTER) ... And she ... wiped .. the frog slime , ... ((LAUGHTER) off her lips . ... Ugh . ... And that's the story of the other frog prince . ((LAUGHTER) APPLAUSE Thank you very much . Um , ... there are ... a couple of other storytelling events , ... that I'd just like to share with you , ... one is in Elgin tomorrow evening . Jim May is going to be , um , .. doing some .. stories , uh , for a church group there , and you -- .. It's a public uh .. occasion , and you'd all be welcome , I'll leave some fliers for you here if you'd like them . .. And uh next Saturday , at the McHenry County Conservation District , which isn't really all that far . .. Um , ... Rosalee Sorrells , who is a well-known .. folk singer and storyteller , will be doing a program , and , at seventhirty , and you'd all be welcome to come . .. We'd love to have you there . ... So I thank you ... very much , if any of you have occasions to use storytellers , I'd be happy to talk with you , or to find you an appropriate storyteller for , any other group you might belong to . ... Thank you very much . APPLAUSE You guys are awesome . .. What a great audience . APPLAUSE ... Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen , ... It's uh , ... truly a historic occasion ... today , ... to have among us , ... a citizen who has contributed so much , ... not only to this .. entire area , ... but t- to the world of ceramics , ... and also to the world of literature , ... and been part nan ,  of one of the great .. artistic movements , ... which .. revolutionized , ... the way ... art was considered , ... and which today still has , ... extraordinary resonance , ... in the work ... of younger artists , ... who are .. rediscovering , ... something that was discovered , ... at the v- -- almost at the beginning of this century , ... and with which .. Miss Wood , ... was so intimately involved . ...  ? ... To have .. the Mother .. of Dada .. with us ,  ((LAUGHTER_AND_APPLAUSE) Let's keep  , Is this it . is in .. deed a pleasure . N- now , I would like to .. hold forth , but .. I don't think I'm going to be allowed to . ... ((LAUGHTER) So ,  Beatrice nan , .. it is yours  .   Is my voice alright . ... ((MURMURS_AND_APPLAUSE) Like this alright . Now , referring to that period , just mentioned . .. It all ... touched me , ... by the name ... no . No is the most dangerous word in the English language . .. And , .. it has absolutely .. changed my life . .. For instance , .. ... I was brought up , ... very carefully , ... I was a good little girl . ... And I was in great revolt . ... My mother saw that I had a governess , that I went to private schools , and I was in -- .. I didn't like this at all . ... Now , ... one day , ... I met Elisa . ... A journalist . She knew writers , she knew artists , she lived a bohemian life , and I was very .. attracted . And interested . So I invited her ... to home , .. for luncheon . ... After she left , my mother said to me , ... she's common . ... ((LAUGHTER) That .. hurt me . ... ... That was first .. no . ... Alright , So the next time , ... I went to see her , .. ... and , ... she had a little apartment in Greenwich Village , and she said , ... there's a .. young musician , of twentysix . Who's broken his leg , he's French , he's very lonely , you speak French , so go see him . ... So nan , I went to see him in the hospital , and it was Varese , the musician of the avant-garde music , and , the second time I went to call on him , Marcel .. Duchamp .. was there . The great painter , .. of The Nude Descending the Staircase . ... Alright . Marcel Duchamp , introduced me , to , Henri-Pierre Roche . .. .. Roche was a .. collector .. of art , and .. a diplomat , uh sent by the French government , very correct , he called on my parents twice , ... and after he left , .. my mother said , ... you're in love with that man . You shouldn't see him again . I didn't know whether I was or not ,  but I was attracted . ... Alright . .. That was her ... second .. no . ((LAUGHTER)  So , very politely , he called a third time , .. and I said , oh nan . I was at the phone , I'll come to see you . ... He said , oh no , I just have a little apartment in Greenwich Village , it's nothing at all , I said oh that's alright , I don't mind , he said , no no no , it's -- It's not -- It's not attractive . I said look . .. I'm .. shopping just around the corner , I see you get the point .   It was a lie , if I ever said one . ((LAUGHTER)  So , I um , ... m- ... decided , and I went to see him . ... And I entered his .. very simple little room , I looked around it , and I remembered there were very coarse curtains , and the sun shone through them , made them like gold , and I stood in his room , ... and he was very nice gentlemanly man , he didn't quite know what to do , so he came , and he stood opposite me , and looked at me , ... And , I saw a painting on his .. wall , and I saw , a .. glass of water on the table , ... and , ... he wasn't saying anything . .. So , finally I .. looked at him , and I said , ... aren't you going to show me your .. etchings ? From that time on , I was never a good little girl . ((LAUGHTER_AND_APPLAUSE) That , it was the kind of life I wanted . ... He , ... uh , nan ... he nan , and Duchamp , introduced me to the Arensbergs , and I met all the great artists of that day , and had a wonderful time . I was just I think twentytwo , going on twentythree , so , .. I was of age . And my mother couldn't say anything . ((LAUGHTER)   Now , ... I'm very .. international , ... in feeling . ... I've traveled quite a good deal , .. and , to me as I travel , people ... are the same .. everywhere . .. And in spite .. of having .. this feeling for the whole world . .. .. I love that I'm a Californian , I -- ((LAUGHTER) I was born in San Francisco , and one of the reasons I love California so much , ... is , .. that it's kinky . And -- ((LAUGHTER) But this is very important . Because , new ideas , ... come up because it's kinky . ... And , .. it's just wonderful , the .. marvelous new ideas that come up . And of course , what I ... like about ... America , ... because , in spite of being ... very international in my feeling , I think ours , is a wonderful country . .. We're quick in friendship . We are ... open to new ideas . We .. made , we presented many .. new inventions . ... But , ... and this is very serious . .. Our , ... um , ... uh , .. athletes , ... our actors nan , are getting millions . ... And our teachers , .. are being cut down . And our libraries nan , are being closed . ... This is very very serious , it's putting a block ... on knowledge , China , and other Middle East country- -- Not other Middle East but nan , ... Middle East countries and China , and other countries nan , .. are realizing the importance of education . And going after it . .. And we , .. are cutting down . In that direction . And it worries me a great deal . Now . ... ... One of the wonders of America , .. however , .. in spite of the bad things , .. several years ago , Tony Prieto , uh , .. who taught ceramics , ... I think at Mills College , he and his wife , went to Europe . ... To learn . And we he rela- turned , he said , Europe shares nothing . ... America shares . And because America shares nan , our craft movement . Has grown so wonderfully . .. We're doing wonderfully inventive things in craft . Uh , I have been very fortunate myself , I'm not naturally a craftan , but , I've had four .. very wonderful craften , to help me , uh Lukens at USC , the Natzlers , Otto and Gertrud Natzler , great potters , when they first came to America , Gertrud Natzler , would sit by me at the wheel , and help me .. try , to see what throwing was about , then , my colleagues in Ojai , Vivika and Otto Heino , they've been so generous , they're teachers , they pass down everything , they've helped me , .. and uh , ... I remember Toshiko Takaezu , her name's so hard for me to say , was visiting me , she spent a day and a half helping me , ... center on the wheel . All this sharing . In our schools . Amongst craftan themselves . Is a wonderful thing . So the movements go on . .. And of course nan , .. our museums nan . .. Are so .. important . I don't know , ... if military ... minded people , ... hope nobody from the FBI is here , If our military people , if uh , realize , .. the importance of museums , museums protect all the great art . The great invention . The creative efforts of man from the beginning of time . .. And , ... they're our inspiration , and I think our museums are doing wonderfully now , even though , we're beginning to cut down on education . ... ... I uh , ... I feel , ... about the importance , ... of craft . ... Of bringing ... beauty . .. Craft into life . ... One day .. I said to Vivika Heino . ... Because I'm a snob about art . Ever since a child , I've been dragged , through the museums of Europe , and America , and my eyes are exposed to great art . So I said , ... you know , ... it's a mistake , ... to teach ... .. cr- pottery , ... in high school . ... The students haven't time to make anything beautiful and important . ... And Vivika Heino so wisely answered , .. that is not the purpose . It opens them . ... To aesthetics . .. And that's what right education does . .. Now , I wonder . ... We have ... a tremendous ... population in prison . ... And it's growing , we can hardly ... house them . ... Why . ... We put the cart before the horse . ... We put people in prison . .. Why . ... Because they have not had right education in the beginning . .. And right ... education , is the basis .. of everything . ... Now ha- I'll .. end with one other .. idea , and then you can ask me questions , and that is this . ... .. Since there is an Olympic .. of athletes . ... .. Why not have an Olympic , ... of ethnic and tribal dancers , from .. countries all over the world . Then people could come , and meet , they'd have beautiful costumes , friendships would be made , and , ... I don't think we can have peace , ... just with guns . Peace comes through friendship . And friendships would be made , with all these dancers intermingling . And even dancing with each other . ... Because , ... when you touch , ... you don't shoot . ... APPLAUSE .. And nan , ... I base this nan , on a little experience of my own , when I was in , uh .. uh Ojai . As a sweet young thing . I would go dancing at the art center . I knew all kinds of square dancing , folk dancing , nobody cared , ... who we were dancing with , if it was the rich rancher , or , a man taking care of trash , ... nobody cared . As long as he was a good dancer . And after ,  every month , we had a party . And .. all of us , mixed together in friendship . That .. is wonderful . And , something like this could happen . If we had great dances . So , ... I come back , my last ... word is , ... violence , .. never ends , ... with violence . ... And right education , ... is the basis , .. of everything . ... APPLAUSE .. Well , I do hope that there is someone from the FBI here , to relay this message ,  to the State Department . ((LAUGHTER) Because if the State Depart- -- Okay ? ... I .. hope that there is someone from the FBI here , so that they could tell it to the State Department None .   ((LAUGHTER_AND_APPLAUSE)  3..   Miss Wood asked me to .. inform everyone , that her hearing was rather ... difficult , at the moment , and so , uh , I will have to speak very loud , and clearly , so so- she can hear what I say . Yes , I'm very hard ... of hearing . ... Age . There's no getting around it , ((LAUGHTER) so , Mister Perrot will take questions . So , if you will ask your questions clearly , and please don't make them too long , s- -- because I might forget , ... the beginning , by the time I reach the end , ((LAUGHTER) Uh , then , I will relay them to Miss Wood . ... And , ... uh , as far as I know , there are no restrictions , on any questions , that you could ask . ((LAUGHTER) ... Who would like -- ... Yes . ... Beatrice . ... when did you first get , .. uh , ... into a living relationship in Paris . With all those wonderful artists . At what age . W- w- when did you get into a living relationship , with those p- ... artists in Paris , ... at what .. age . ... With artists in Paris . Yes . ... .. Um , I went to study .. art in Paris . A little bit . .. But I .. really didn't .. meet ... any answers , and to ... answer your question the way I think you would like it answered , ((LAUGHTER)   I was twentythree . .. In New York . ..  ... Mhm . ((LAUGHTER)  ..   And , it was my mother's no .  ((LAUGHTER) That , I was so , ... really , b- b- .. bothered . ... By her remarks . ... That I just broke loose . And went , ... in the direction I wanted . ... She wanted , a different direction . ... Social life . ... Have me married to a ... stock broker . Oh . .. I wouldn't be here , I would've murdered him . ((LAUGHTER_AND_APPLAUSE)   2...  I say this , in spite of not believing in violence . My whole life changed . And I think I was very lucky . Because , ... ... three -- oh four friends , did so much , to ... help my education . Marcel Duchamp , Roche , the collectors , the Walter Arensebergs , and then , ... my old schoolmate , Elizabeth Reynolds Hapgood . .. Hapgood was co , was uh .. editor of Collier's , a ... close friend of President Wilson , .. and Elizabeth herself , spoke Russian . So she knew , this was years and years ago , before even any of your grandmothers were alive . ((LAUGHTER) None  Uh , (%) None , it was uh , uh , she knew all the Russian ambassadors , Pavlova , Nijinsky , uh , Isadora Duncan , all those people . I met through my own schoolmate , Elizabeth ... Hapgood . ... So I have been .. very .. lucky . ... Another question ? ... You fear I'll tell the truth . .. ((LAUGHTER) Bravo .     Nothing but . How was your relationship with your mother , after you .. broke away from her . ... How was your relationship with your mother , after you broke away from her . ... Um , ... I broke away , I was acting then . In the French theatre . ... .. -- .. I wasn't really , .. too interested , in the stage . .. But , in those early years , ... I thought it was the only way I could earn money . .. And I threatened my mother to run away , .. so she said , if you really mean that , I'll take you to Paris . And you can study under the Comedie , .. Comedie Francaise . Because she thought , that if I .. acted in French , .. it was safer . Than if I acted , ((LAUGHTER) .. in America . So , ... I , .. ... uh , ... I was acting in the French theatre , ... then I -- I was the ingenue , I spoke perfect French , had beautiful clothes ,  uh , .. for two years , I think I did over sixty parts . But I want to act in English . ... And my good friend , Elizabeth Hapgood . On account of Russian and knowing , so many ... people in the theatre . ... I got many parts offered me , and my mother said , No . ... You get leading lady , or nothing . Now , ... part of me was really , a good little girl . Part of me , so I was very .. subdued . And , my spirit was being broken . Because she'd say , no . .. No . You can't do that , you can't do that . ... And then , ... a woman came from Canada . .. And said , will you come up for three weeks . ... To Canada , ... and act in the theatre there . .. On salary . ... And I said yes . And that's , when I broke , ... with my home . ... And , my mother , ... had a nervous breakdown for two days , and my father said , ... you're killing your mother . ... and I said , ... she's killing me . ... And I'm the younger , and I have a right to live . ... APPLAUSE WOOD And I'll always , And I'll always , let you know , .. where I am . Now , I should say something nice about my mother . ((LAUGHTER)  She was beautiful , .. and very generous , but she was in a way of thinking , you know , we didn't have radio , we didn't have television , life wasn't as open as it is now . And , any mother , .. would want , a protected , .. social life for their daughter . ... Probably . ... Now , ((LAUGHTER) ... when she died , in .. thirtysix . ... I had left home then , oh , for quite a few years . ... The last three months of her life we became friends . And she let go . .. Of all that kind of ... thing . That didn't interest me , and she was very wonderful uh , and open , and the last day of her life , she was dying of cancer , she was , conscious , she knew she was going that night , we joked about it , and , she said , now . Tomorrow , I understand there's a wonderful exhibition , don't tell any of the others , but go see it . She knew she wouldn't be here then , she was just wonderful . So I'm very happy to be say -- To s- .. be able to say , we became friends . .. At the end . ... Mhm . APPLAUSE ... Yes , in the back . Can you expand , uh , just a bit , about your ... thoughts on uh , .. bringing art to the prisons . ... Could you explain , a little bit , about bringing .. art to the prisons None . Your thoughts , about bringing art , .. to the prisons . ... I think it'd be wonderful . ... Uh , ... I've always been , ... concerned about people being in prison , ... but I really don't know , ... very much , ... I just think it's a terrible thing . ... That we have so many , in prison . ... And I'm sure , ... we could s , .. what is called save the lives , .. of endless people , if they had a creative ... outlet . But what is a ... young person to do . ... ... Brought up , ... not knowing in any way right from wrong , no compassion , seeing bing bing bing , guns used all the time , no money , drugs , ... why should they not steal . ... ... Now , ... I don't know if this has any value , it's personal . .. ... ... When I left home , I made a very unhappy marriage , .. in name only . But the man , it was a disaster . And I was , for quite a few years , without any money . ... And I mean , I sold w- my own books , to get money to eat . I know what it is , to be , at zero . ... I was not trained for the world . I didn't know , .. how .. to relate .. to the world . But uh , once a week , I always went back to see my parents . .. and , they never said .. anything . They never blamed me . From that time on . My mother said , .. she always had a very good , uh , luncheon for me . Suspecting , that I was hungry . .. And I was . One day she said , go up ... to my room , and get some information out of my purse . .. I went there , I opened her purse , it was full .. of money . ... And , ... I had the impulse to take some . ... I knew she wouldn't care , ... she probably sent me up almost to ... take some . ... And I stood . ... And then something in me said , ... no . ... That is not .. the way ... to live . ... And I didn't take it . ... Now , this is just a very poor little example . ... ... But , ... when you have ... no education , when you haven't read , I'd read a great deal . Of very fine books , also a lot of trash . .. But I'd enjoyed readings . ((LAUGHTER) Now , you have no guide , when you're a young person . Why shouldn't you steal , why shouldn't you shoot . Why shouldn't you go to prison . But look .. what we're paying .. for people in prison , instead of putting this , .. into education . You see , I feel , ... our .. culture , ... misses the first ... sell . ... Which I come back I say , is right education . And of course , ... from what I know , I've never had children , so I say this with apology , but I understand , ... that it's vital . ... For women to love their infants . To cuddle their infants . And from what I've read , all criminals , all abnormal people , it's because they've never been loved as young , .. youngsters . ... Yes . APPLAUSE I would like to , .. hear something about , how she came to be called , ... the Mother of Dada . ... How did you become the Mother of Dada . . ... Do you ell the dog on me ? ... Yeah ? ... Okay . down boy . ... Down boy . ... Mmkay . ... Jamie wrote this out , .. in a hurry this morning , ... Yeah , she said she thought she had , .. gotten a brand inspection done , since she got to Colorado ? ... But then she said she didn't know where it was and , that's what he wanted to know . I've never heard of it . So , ... P- he .. -- That's what I need to know , he said if there was a prior brand inspection , then he would have to go off of that one . Trash -- If there was no prior brand inspection , None  then he could just go off of this , and issue me a new one . .. If -- Is there a brand inspection , if we bring one in from out of state ? Well , she said since it was not required in California when she bought the pony , which it is now , they reinstated it about a year ago . Oh .  She -- I thought she said she had had one done here . ... Oh . .. But , .. if she didn't ,  I wouldn't know . you know , I don't do any horse things . I just need -- All I need to know is , if she ever had one done , .. or if she didn't . He said , if she didn't have one done , sh- he'll just go .. off the papers . Yeah .  And this . ... These papers here ? .. Unhunh . Okay . ... And I sent in the Arab papers to be , ... uh , transferred to my name . They haven't been  transferred , since nineteenseventyseven .  I don't know how many owners she's had . But it hasn't -- ... Wow . ... You don't remember the name of the people you bought her from . Do you ? ... No , but then that's not ... unusual , Yeah . cause I -- You don't ride do you . I don't ride , and I'm not involved , the only thing I do is , um , Pay the bills . .. I'm -- No . She pays the bills , I -- I .. earn the ... the money to pay the bills , but , she uh , .. I do the hard labor . I build barns and , make arenas , ... shovel manure , that's about it . ... ... Well I really like this pony . She's gonna work out great here . Alright . good .  She's gonna go competitive trail riding . .. Do the novice , thirty-mile competitive trail rides , Wow . with a , an eleven-year-old this year . Wow .  So this eleven-year-old horse is a little bit big for her , and she's still intimidated on him out on the trails , even though he's great . So I'm gonna take him this year , and she's gonna take ... the pony , and , .. she's , she had her at the Air Force Academy Sunday and just , had a great time . Alright . Was i- on a trail or something ? And she now goes through water just fine . ... Through water . Yes . 3.. That's great . she goes through running water this deep . Happily now . That's great .  And all the kids had to do was get her through nan -- Get her in a couple times , and she decided it was fun . She likes it . ..     And , now you don't even have to ask . That's great . She just goes . ... So , seventeen years old they can still learn something . ... Uh , .. now how do you , ... get on a trail ride at the .. Air Force Academy . ... Well , they have a lotta trails there , we just trailer over there . ... We just .. load the horses in a trailer home . Alright . .. That's neat . ... And head over .

Since he's -- Well he's been lonesome for a long time . Cause he's been kept alone all his life , he was -- wasn't gelded till he was eleven .  So . ... One of these .. you get .. to keep , how about that one . Mmkay . ... And uh , ... I guess that's it hunh ? And then just have Jamie call me , Now , yeah . and let me know , if she's ever had a brand inspection done on this pony , since she got to Colorado , because if there's a prior brand inspection on her ? ... Right . Then it -- There'll be a record of it . ... Okay . ... And then I would need it . or .. need ... some way to look it up . .. It gets kinda ... screwy . Okay . ... .. And they look like this . ... In -- In either pink or blue , ... Or , if you have a permanent one , ... Let's see if I've got a permanent one here with me . ... I bet not . ... What happened to Matt . ... I don't know , I think he wandered off . He just left . Okay . ...   Uh , I sure like your daughter's new horse . Co -- she's lovely . Oh uh Fancy ? None She's beautiful . .. Beautiful pony . ... Horse Yeah . ... Nah I don't have any permanents here . Okay it's the , Colorado Department of g- Agriculture . .. ... Department of Agriculture . ... I guess . ... Okay . ... Yeah . And what do you call that . That's uh , ... Well it's -- State Board .. of Stock Inspection . ... You know it doesn't cost much to do it , but it is a law . ... and , So long . ... You leaving ? Mm . pull your horse in h- -- You wouldn't believe how good he felt , when I took him out to grass this morning ? ... He was ... dancing on the end of the lead rope , And arch -- Cause he knew where he was going . but he did it on the way up- .. back too . ... Oh . .. He had his neck arched , and he's just like vibrating with energy , Oh good . Maybe I should go out and ride him now . I guess you should . Woo (sniff) .  Bye .   Bye . Did you see my patio I'm putting in ? ... Look how much is done now . Oh it's a patio ? I thought you were gonna grass it . .. No . I told you I'm gonna do a flagstone patio . You told me you were gonna grass it . That's why I took out all these rocks over here . ... That's my roommate Karen . Oh . ... Okay ? Is -- Well I never know what you're gonna do .. from week to week .     Okay , uh , it's a law , ... Who's supposed to do this . The buyer or the seller or , ... or what . ... I don't know . ... I think the seller is supposed to . ... Oh . Usually the seller's supposed to pay for it , but I just , ... I just do it and I pay for it , it doesn't really make that much difference to me , cause it's only like seven bucks . ... To do it . ... Okay . .. But , if she ha- -- I mean it's not a big deal , ... I just need to know if she had one done or didn't have one done . Okay . Cause it'll make a difference on what the brand inspecttor does . Okay . ... If she did have one done , I need to know about when . If she can't find the copy ? ... So they can look it up ? Okay . ... And I doubt if they're .. terribly computerized . ... ((DOOR_CLOSING) Cause I had this happen once before , when I lost the brand inspection on a horse I'd bought , .. but I remembered the month that I bought it in . And I happened to buy it out at the .. auction . It was one of my -- There's a movie sitting on the desk out there . What is it . ... The Substitute Wife . .. Oh . .. Was that any good ? It was very good . Oh good . You mean Farrah Fawcett has learned to act ? Didn't we see -- ... Well it was funny . Oh okay . It was different . I don't know how realistic it was . I just didn't think she looked the part of a plains wife . but it was different . ... No , No .  ... Too many teeth and hair  . Bye . .. ((DOOR_CLOSING)  Well , ... Th- -- okay this is what you get , and the guy hands it to you , None Mhm None , ... Yeah . ... Okay . ... I have no idea . So I'll have to ask her None . And s- -- I'm the -- .. Okay I'm the agent . Let's see this is gonna go to the owner . So yeah . The owner would have the blue copy . ... The a- I was the agent on this horse . ... I'm not the owner . ... So , ... But course , The -- we got him last July . So it's been almost a year  , I just -- I just .. can't bear to bring the brand inspector out for just one horse , because it's only like seven bucks , now this one was seventeen , because , he's getting a permanent brand inspection . ... Which you can keep , ... for the , for as long as you own the horse . ... What is a brand inspection . But it's -- What it is is your only .. legal .. bill of sale , for .. horse or cattle , .. in the State of Colorado . Oh . ... Registration -- It's like registering a car . ... Right . And and -- Or or uh , ... not registering , but uh , passing title . .. Mhm . To a car . And , .. see the thing is , what makes it good , is if you don't have a legal ... brand inspection ? ... On a horse when you take him to the auction , you can't run him through the auction , they will impound the horse . Wow .  So , if somebody goes and forges , WHISTLE a little bill of sale that looks like this , ... and steals a horse out of my pasture , and takes it to the auction , they're gonna impound the horse and check it out . ... Look for identifying marks . .. And .. not send that horse to the killers . Oh okay . .. Okay . That's why it's real important .  .. Yeah . .. How do you uh , .. I guess you just look it up in the phone book , for uh , ... Well you usually you can- you can -- Colorado State Department of Agriculture or something .  I can never find it in the phone book . Call the vet . All the vets know the number . Vet , of the .. brand inspector . okay . And I have it on file too . His name is um , ... our our current brand inspector is a real cutie . Let's see . What's his name . ... Bart Zuckerman . ... Is our current brand inspector . Okay . And he lives right here in Colorado Springs . Oh yeah ? Hey . It's a five five five number . ... Okay .

Really nice looking young fellow . ... I don't know . He's got- -- I think he's got a couple kids . ... But , very nice . ... Polite cowboy type . ... ... And on our last -- Alright . I just get used to a brand inspector and they switch em on us .  Donald Bradbury was our brand inspector for years . And um , ... I mean , he knew me real well because I , ... I'd go through seven eight horses a year out here and , Wow . .. Well , What do you what do you do here . cause I'm an -- I'm an agent . .. I teach riding lessons , Oh . and I buy and sell , and I'm an agent . Oh . I'll -- I'll find horses for people , that nan Okay . .. And .. so I act as an agent . So you 4.. match a a a customer with a horse . Yeah it's sorta like a dating service . It's wonderful . Yeah . It's really a lotta fun . Yeah .  Yeah .  So they know that , ... that you can do this , so they tell you , hey , I really need this kind of a horse . Right .  Well (%) m- None -- Most of the time it's my students ? .. And when they're ready to buy a horse , Yeah . then I look for a horse for em ? Yeah .  Like with uh Peggy's horse , I looked at twenty-eight horses in ten days . WHISTLE . before I found the one that I thought would suit her . WHISTLE . .. And she's a wonderful horse . ... And I didn't even dicker on the price for her . Because I thought the price was so good . Mhm ?  And we paid twenty-five hundred for her . And she was a nine-year-old Anglo Arab , ... Um , about ... fifteen three , ... lovely mare . She's cleaning up in competitive trail and , and doing reasonably well at the shows . ... And the mare's real cute , takes good care of her , she hunts her , goes out to the , ... the .. fox hunt and hunts her all winter ? Fox hunt . Yeah we hunt . But we hunt coyotes in Colorado .

Out , uh it's at -- What club is that . It's the Bijou Springs , ... Bi- -- ... No . ... Bijou Hunt Club . ... B- Bijou Springs Hunt Club I guess it's called . .. And it's out at ... Bijou Springs Ranch ,  we lease .. twenty-thousand acres to hunt on out there with the kennels . WHISTLE .  Costs us ... twelve-thousand six-hundred dollars a year for the lease , ... for the right to hunt out there , and have the clubhouse and the kennels . .. And it belongs to , ... think of his name . ... Real rich guy .  He's got a hunting preserve , preserve on the place with elk and , Wow .  white-tail deer and , Where is Bijou Springs . he's getting moose now . ... Oh it's out .. close to Calhan . ... It's gorgeous country . Calhan . It's like , ... northwest . Just northwest of Calhan . And it's beautiful beautiful country . ... Way out there in nowhere . Out wh- -- Th- are there any trees out there ? Or is it -- None Mhm None . Yeah , we have a lotta trees , We hunt through the trees , and bounce off them from time to time and ,    .. We have several scars in this barn , from people bouncing off of trees  . ... Golly day .  It's it's not --  That sounds like fun though . ... It's not a sport for the timid . ... You've gotta be .. pretty brave . To do it . Or stupid . Mm . .. It's a it's sport for either the brave or the stupid .  .. I've never done it .  My dad has done it . ... W- -- .. the fox hunting ? He's -- Mhm . On horseback ? Mm . ... Where at ? ... California ? Down .. near uh , Do you know the name of the hunt ? ... No , I don't know anything . .. .. Let's see . ... ... No . ... All I ..

If you're interested ? Sure ? .. I've -- I've been out hunting for a rake , but I found it . ... Oh your brother's sitting in his car . ... Why is he doing that . Oh . With his tape recorder sitting here . I don't know . ... He's uh ,  He's just .. recording conversations .  So we'll just keep it going here . ..  ... They're not .. for content , they're doing it for linguistic ... purposes . Right , for linguistics . ... Making a m- .. massive database , ... Come on dogs . ... Dogs . Come on . ... Come on . That's good . That's enough . Okay . Two dogs is enough at once . ...  ... Ask him if he'd like to come see the barn . ... Matt ? ... You wanna see the barn ? ... Sure . ... Let me give you this . I didn't know you'd come out to sit in your car . ... Oh , ... just taking it easy here . Yeah ? .. Here you go -- So you got a new barn ? Or a old barn .  ... It's down here . ... The barn's new  . ... Well that's a big dog . .. Or is this a horse . .. Puppy .  Pony . .. It's a puppy . .. Oh yeah , ... What kind is he . ...  He's a Great Dane . .. Great Dane . ... He was left starving and sick at my vet's clinic for -- ... pretty bad shape , ... They picked him up and I adopted him from the Humane Society . .. He weighed .. seventy-two pounds , and now he weighs a hundred and fifty . ...  .. Christmas gift .  Seventy two pounds ? He -- He got me for Christmas . I can't imagine that dog ,  weighing seven pounds . Seventytwo ? ... And now he's -- He must've had a lotta ribs showing .  He was -- .. Oh , you could see his hips , every , every bone in his spine , Mm . So what were -- What was happening to him ? ..  Well he had real bad diarrhea , and he hadn't been fed properly , and he didn't have the right nutrition , so hopefully he won't get to the size he should . ..  Hopefully he's almost fullgrown .  .. Yeah . Cause , cause male Great Danes can get upwards of a hundred and seventy-five pounds . .. Mm . ... And I don't want him to get that big . Hi Hap . ... That's Hap . ... He's one of those wild thoroughbreds . .. Yeah ? ... He's a boarder . ... I now own --  ? What does that mean . He boards here . ... I board -- Oh oh oh . Yeah . ... I only own five of em now , and two of them are .. somewhere else , cause I don't have room for em . ... My mare and foal are down the hill . ... What is that . It's a granary , it holds about four-thousand pounds of grain . Oh . Wow . Yeah . .. I have -- I've never seen anybody had one of those at a barn . .. Well I feed ... between twenty and .. twenty-five horses all year round . .. WHISTLE So I can't buy it by the sack . ... ... I go through -- They have trucks come out here . ... Yeah I go through about three-hundred pounds a day . ...  Oh man .  .. I go through ten , Incredible .  Ten to twelve tons of hay a month . ... Roughly , ten to twelve thousand dollars a year of hay . .. You must have been .. hurting this last season . Hunh ? No actually , my hay supplier was real good to me . ... How did you do that . ... I mean it was hard for everybody . I've been buying hay , I've been buying hay from Bartlett's , for six years now . ... and I don't -- I'm not his biggest customer , ... but I've been real steady and real loyal , We had a r- -- and I've ... referred him to a lotta people . ... And um , We had a lotta , .. we had a , He kept my hay price -- shortage of hay this year . Because of uh , He -- Yeah . It was the floods out in --  But see he knows how much -- he buys a lotta hay , he's a broker . ... And he buys hay , And actually I usually get the Wyoming hay , and it got ruined in the rain . So I was getting West Cliff hay , which I don't think is quite as good , it's good . But not quite as good . Unhunh , But he kept my hay price down to a hundred and twenty-five dollars a ton . Which is .. how much ,  All  winter . Delivered and stacked . Wow . Was that a -- Which is really good  . What does that boil down to per .. bale . Well he was selling it to other people , that .. came and picked it up , for a hundred and sixty-five . ... A ton . ... But I get twenty-two to twenty-five tons at a time . ... WHISTLE He just brings a semi-load in here . I'll bet . ... What does that .. boil down to per bale . There's Shiba . Do you know ? ... No . No it -- .. It's roughly , ... anywhere from twenty-eight to thirty , ... um , ... bales per .. ton . ... But , I always buy by the ton , because then I know how much feed I have . ... Yeah . You know , when you buy this much , you can't go by the bale . It's kinda silly . Yeah , right .  See there's Shiba . Yeah . ... Hey Shiba ? ... .. Come here girl . WHISTLE ((CLAP_CLAP_CLAP) ... Are you sleepy ? ... And that's her boyfriend Beamer . ... He's so -- He's so happy , he thinks he has a whole mare herd now to protect . Alright . ... Hm . She's been in high heat the last couple days .  ... He thinks that's wonderful . ... Shiba's been in heat ? Oh yeah . See how she -- See what she's doing ? ... Squirting on him . Oh yuck . Miserable old mare .  .. He likes it , ... This one's in heat too , and he won't pay any attention to her , and she's really frustrated . ... Cause poor mare , she's been off her feet for two days because , ... Beamer rushes the fence , and bears his teeth , and , ... pins his ears at her , ... because he d- -- He .. doesn't want her to get next to his mare . He keeps himself between his mare and , .. and that one , who might threaten his mare herd .  He's really a funny character . I give lessons on him too , he's privately owned but , his owner doesn't ride him much . And he's real gentle . ... He um , he was shown out in California ,  He -- .. he rides Western English and drives . He pulls a cart . Wow . ... And he's just as cute as can be . He's a little Morgan . They're ... identical color aren't they ? Unhunh ? ... And she's just sure that this one's going to be it . ... Actually he's doing better than my stallion . Wow . My stallion can't get it figured out .    He's only three  . ... And we ... tried breeding him to a mare the other day , and she was going out of heat , wasn't very strong , And he was just a lot more interested in the Gelding next to her , and I said , this is what I need is a gay stallion .  (SNIFF)    .. A gay stallion  . ... Oh I said , well , that way at least I don't have to worry about gelding him . And he'll keep his pretty coat , you know we just won't worry about him . ... And he's real even tempered but . We just had his first foal . He did manage to breed my old mare last year . But she's really experienced . And I just turned em out to pasture together for three days , .. and she was patient with him . .. Hm . But then he fell in love with her and it was -- (WHINNY) ... He was -- .. Um , ... what do you call it . ... He only wanted the one mare . .. He wouldn't look at any of the others last year . So we didn't get anybody else bred last year . But two is a little young to be asking anything . Watch this now . Watch him rush at her . rush at her . ... See if he goes . ... See and her buddy , ... um , the reason she's here , this black mare , she's here for board and training , she hadn't been ridden in five years . ... And her um , ... pal of ten ye , ten years had to be put down a few weeks ago . ... He just was so crippled up and old and , Mm . suffering and , she didn't want .. to keep the mare at home , after .. they put the other horse down , cause .. she figured she'd get frantic . So she came here to have more friends . ... To make friends . Yeah . ... Well these are -- So what did you do to your arena . ... Um , ... well last year I put in a whole new ring . I spent about three thousand dollars leveling it ? Because it wasn't quite level , I -- .. I'd had it ... leveled when I moved here , but it w- .. really wasn't level ? Mhm ?  And the sand that I had in it .. -- There was natural sand in it when I bought the place , It had all washed down the road , and I p- think Kettle Creek scooped it up and put it in their ring ,  So it was hard .. as a rock . None   None And it kept washing out . And it was terrible and , .. like riding on asphalt . So , I had , ... Well you were probably down to the hardpack . ... I was down to clay . Mm .  And I had Havens come out , and -- with a bulldozer . And he leveled the whole thing , he took a whole bunch out of this corner you can see , Yeah .  And put it down in that corner . .. Yeah . And , it just ... was a lot nicer . And then I had , ... three-hundred tons of sand brought in and spread . WHISTLE  It was great in the winter time ? When it was all frozen , and I had this much soft stuff on top ? but when it thawed , we couldn't ride in it , it was this deep . Oh . It was horrid . And the horses have had a hard time . Too much , So today -- Finally it's been dry enough for Tad to come out and , ... and take the rest of the sand off . And I sold it to him , Oh he was taking it out .  He was taking it out . Oh okay , I saw the big dumptruck .  Yeah . Well , that was Havens was taking it out . Um , Orville Havens . ... and uh his son . Which I can't remember his name . Starts with an el . Lenny or something . And he was taking it to someplace else . Lenny and Orville .  He was taking it to one of my students , who lives .. on the road behind me , who put in a ring but didn't have any sand yet . Okay . Okay .  So she got a great deal . She got about a third of my sand , that I paid , twelve or thirteen-hundred dollars for delivered , and she got it a , got about a third of it , for about two-hundred and fifty bucks . Hey that's good . ... And so it was a lot cheaper than if she'd bought it , Yeah . cause I only charged her , a buck , ... a buck a ton , which is what I paid for it . But then I had to pay a lot more to have it hauled in . .. Yeah .  The hauling is what costs so much . ... But I'll sh- -- So uh , ... yeah , you know , ... My , my arena isn't very .. level . ... Well it cost her a lot less to level hers , but it wasn't as big as mine , or as ... unlevel . ... This is my tractor . ... It's masquerading as an Isuzu . But .. it really is my tractor .  Foggy meadows . ... My handyman did that . I haven't seen him for a while , I think he quit . And didn't tell me . ... That's my roommate -- One of my roommate's horses is here , and one's in there but , .. he's hiding . ... And then , this is the field -- This is what we call the witch field , the mares live out there , they get turned out there during the day , ... and then .. that's the gelding field , and my stallion lives out with the geldings , ... And Bruge stands here half the day wanting to come in , and then after he goes in he wants to go out . ..  ..  He's like a lotta people's children in the winter time . The mare field and the gelding field . .. And the Chestnut -- You see a dark grey on this side ? And then a chestnut .. with his tail to us , ... Yeah . The chestnut is my stallion . .. And he's just as mellow as -- .. He's mellower than most geldings . He's a sweetheart . ... And the mare and baby , are .. up the road , a half mile , ... If you go .. through the .. gateposts ? Th- where it says Stray Winds Two ? And just go through there and look to your left , there's a pasture . And I've got the mare and baby up there in a seven-acre pasture . Wow . ... And we've got -- None Wow None . ... Right now we're down to twenty horses here . Which is great . ... And then , my roommate's old horse is going out to pasture the first of the month too . ... He's um , ... had a real rough year , he had cancer , and , ... he lost one eye , and the other eye is going blind , and this'll probably be his last summer and  , Mm . she's not riding him a whole lot . But he's still pretty happy . .. So we'll put him out to pasture and let him eat grass for a summer , and , see how he is in the fall . ... And if he's , if he's , looks like he's gonna lose the sight in the other eye totally , we'll put him down in the fall . I'm not gonna let him wander around blind . ... It's not fair to him . ... He's been a grand horse . ... But none of ours go to the killers at the end of their life . ... Where do they go . ... They get put down , and then either buried or just hauled off . ... But we put em down at home . ... I don't -- I don't put them through ... going out to the sale and , being menh- manhandled , and stuck in semi trucks , and scared to death at the l- end of their lives . I just , Hm .  don't believe in that . That's probably why I'll .. always be poor . ... But I do a lotta horse rescue . I've bought a lot from the killers . Um , in fact , .. this black horse ... of my roommate's came from , .. he was going to the killer's four years ago . ... Not this one . The one that ... is b- .. blind now . ... And he was considered a killer . ... An unmanageable . ... And he's been perfectly lovely , I give the little kids lessons on him . .. Hm . ... So , I've had him ... four years . .. Sold him to my roommate a couple years ago , it was her ... second horse . ... And uh , ... they've cleaned up in competitive trail and , just had a great time and , ... fox hunted him and ,  He's just real game , Hm . He's a purebred Arabian . All black . ... And he's just great . ... And uh , an- .. nother one I saved from the killers , three years ago , ... the light chestnut with the blond tail swishing at us ? .. Yeah . ... He's a mustang . And he was four years old going to the killers out at Calhan , ... and he was way down on the sales list , and he was pretty spooky . ... So I m- -- I had eight horses at the time , so I made one of my customers buy him . ... I said he's gonna make a wonderful hunt horse , when he gets broke .   And he did . ... And he's absolutely lovely , and he now belongs to a sixteen-year-old girl , who competes him in , hunter jumper , Gees . Naytrack ,  and she hunts him . ... That's great . And she does dressage on him . And he jumps great , he does dressage , he does everything you ask him to do , except drive . We tried driving him , ...  I used to h- h- -- Driving as in , ... putting -- loading him ? ... Driving him with a cart . ... Oh . With a cart . ..  mean , making you pull a wagon .  .. Yes , making him pull a cart . Oh okay . Okay .  Well we did all the groundwork .  There's -- This horse was doing great on the ground , we'd harnessed him , We'd been doing for two years . You know , let's break this horse to drive . Cause he's part Belgian . He's pretty cute . .. He's about a quarter Belgian . And he came from around Reno Nevada . ... And uh , so we did all the groundwork , just had a great time with him , and I had this guy come out that drives Belgians and , ... and he was gonna ... put in fence posts , but the ground was too frozen . So , he said well I don't have anything else to do , and I told him about this horse , he said let me see this horse . And he had Belgians , he said wow , he does look like a baby Belgian . He's real cute .  And he asked me what I'd done to him and ,  Baby Bel- -- and I said well , we've done all this groundwork , we've drug a drag with him , and he's doing really good . So he ... put the harness on , checked it all out for me , cause I don't know .. as , ... that much about it , which is why I'd never hooked him to a cart . We just played on the ground . And um , he said well , everything's good here , and he drove him around , put the drag on him , he said oh , this horse is ready to drive , I said are you sure ? I said when this horse spooks , it's a pretty tremendous spook  . Hm . ...  I said and you don't want him to spook . He said nah , he's gonna be just fine . .. He hooked him to the cart , ... He got in , told me let go , I stepped back two steps , the horse took two steps , ... bucked , kicked the guy out of the cart , took off , the barn door was open . This used to be set up a little differently . Um ,  this fence went straight across and , this was one big field ? .. And I had a different gate . ... Because , he destroyed it . He came out the end of the barn , .. .. jumped ... a four-and-a-half-foot gate ,  ... The cart of course , ashed the gate . ... And he went tearing around this whole field , with all the other horses in here ,  for probably ten minutes . And he jumped , With .. paraphernalia , ... probably straps hanging to him , right ? No . ... The cart was still attached .  None The cart was still attached None .  The cart went through the .. gate  ?  2.. Gee .  The c- (%) the cart went through the gate , knocked the gate flat .  I- -- It was one of the aluminum type- .. type gates ,  like that little one ?  Only it was the big one ? Yeah .  And it was flat , it was mushed , that's why I had to get a new gate . And uh , Incredible . well I've replaced fences since then . But he went tearing around , scared all the other horses to death , and there was a section down there which , ... used to be a part of a fence , You can see it . See the part tha- -- .. It just makes kind of a upside U ? Yeah . Yeah .  He jumped that with the cart too , and knocked it over , I mean , he cleared it . But the ... cart knocked it over . And sent that all flying . ... And finally the cart's wheels got ashed enough , that it just wasn't dragging too well anymore , and he was dragging  dead weight . And he fi , he stopped up on top of this hill ,  and I was going holy cow , Golly day . And in the meantime , I had a little mini about this big that was out there , and he got trampled by .. the other horses . He was okay . Mm . He was on Bute for a couple days . ... And he liked it . ... Real strange . Give me my Bute . ...  All other horses hate it . But he got tram- -- He had hoof prints on his shoulder and ribs .  And another horse , was permanently lame after th- -- He was , ... borderline lame anyway , he was doing walk trot and that's all , an old lame ... Appaloosa , but he broke a bone in his foot . .. He just -- He made a sharp turn ? ... On the hill , and just -- .. He broke off a piece of his side bone .  So he's retired .. totally now . ... Just getting fat and not working . ... Mm . ... And uh , .. but , So much for uh .. carts .  I walked up there  , .. and , hoping he wouldn't run over me , with what was left of the cart . And I took a knife with me , and I was a- -- And I didn't have to use it , I was able to just unhook everything pretty quick , and let him out of the shafts . ... And um , he h- -- .. The only injury he had , And part of the time the shafts , and it's a metal cart , .. the shaft was under his belly , and in between his front legs , and I thought , he's gonna tear himself apart . Mm . Not a mark on his hind legs . He had a puncture wound on the back of his forearm here , ... all ... tiny ... puncture wound . But it swelled up like that . .. He did a lotta ... bruising and muscle damage , Mm , And um , ... the vet happened to be out , .. yeah I think he was -- He came out about an hour later , and I showed him what had happened , and he said yeah , ..  he'll be out for six weeks . Which was ... the b- rest of the hunt season . ... He hunted two weekends later , and was never ever lame . ... . Never lame . He's really tough . And for ... three weeks , Hi . How are you . after I took -- after that ? When I take the cay- .. hay cart out ? ... To feed the horses ? They'd all run and scare and spook .  Cause it sounded just like that pony cart .  .. I'll be darned . ... I tell you what . When do you need to go . ... Forget that cart . I don't need -- Oh . ... Um , ... shoot . ... I need to go now . Okay . .. Okay ? I'm just gonna put this away . I'll just ride Canso tomorrow , Okay . Um , .. I can stay after the lesson and work some  . Alright . .. God I didn't know it was so late .  It's okay . but I have to go . .. That's right . .. Anyway . This is my barn . ... Okay . And then then I have another barn down here and , This is her barn , and , ... These are the turnouts , there's only five-and-a-half acres . ... But it's pretty well arranged . ... I'm her slave , This is my slave for the summer  , You're her slave , oh alright , that's good ,  There's a tack room , oh you did great slave , Doesn't it look good ? it looks wonderful . 2.. Wow . you did that ? My name is Jackie , she cleaned it . it's not really slave . This is Jackie . Hi , Jackie slave ? Alright . This -- Yeah . That looks nice . You wanna look through it ?

I forgot . There's another tack room outside . That's nice .  Well ,  And 2.. this is -- no it -- It wouldn't look right if this left . What do you use to put your -- put your uh , ... these are real , I'm gonna p- -- ... Yeah . Saddleracks . Those are real ... racks . .. Yeah , they're only about twelve bucks apiece . We have uh , ... a triple rack . Mhm ? .. But I haven't hooked it up yet . ... Since we moved . If you want me to do that lesson schedule for you , And it's only been three years a- -- ... Yeah , maybe you can do that . I'll do it . I mean it's -- Clean that up and ,  It's kinda old , .. fix it , I -- I really need .. a keeper . .. I need an organizer to keep me straight .  It's awful in the summer .  I get ... terrible . This is the other tack room ? ... It doesn't look quite as nice , Elaine's mess is still a mess in there . Yeah . ... But I'm gonna get her a tack trunk .. of some kind for her birthday . Looks nice . That looks nice . This rubber ... bit right here is Canso's bridle . .. Mhm . We got it out   . See , this is a real barn Matt . ... Our barn isn't real . This is --  None This is a real barn . .. How many horses do you have . Two . ... Two ,  Oh . yeah . ... Well , .. this one is a -- I bought this place for the barn . I'm sure -- ... And the location . Yeah . Not for the house .  The house is a piece of garbage , but , you know I'm getting attached to it . The inside is starting to look nice , The only thing that was done well on that house , because you're decorating it . was the masonry work though . Hm ? It's starting to look nice on the inside . Yeah . .. Is it -- Do you have enough time to br- -- run me by the vet clinic , before we go pick up my truck , because .. they close at five thirty . I'm fine . ... Okay . As long as I can -- And I've gotta pick up , I've got to give uh Shiba her shots . And .. he ordered the vaccine and it's in , ...  .. Saw dust , Come on . .. or .. shavings I guess , Unhunh .  Hey would you mind turning off the lights for me . ... Yeah . ... Who's i- -- ... Who's in there . ... (GASP) I forgot that horse was in there . Aw . Oh no . No . Who's in that stall .

That whale got beached . He's not ready for that one . No . ... Now , You know how I -- ... Alright  .   ? ... Let's us three get together . ... Us four . ... you want the mat ? ... Bill , you wanted to learn Hanemakikomi . ... Yep . ...  sensei . ... Right ? .. Right . ... Darren , ... drag that ... crashpad to the center of the mats and , ... Bad connection . ... Okay , when I throw you Darren , ... I'm gonna want you to , ... slap real hard . ... Okay , it's gonna be a rather hard fall . This way y'all two can see it . ... Oh boy . ... Okay , ... Well not an oh boy anything , it's -- ... Oh man . ... No you're -- .. Oh God ? ..   There you go . There you go .  Didn't you wanted to hurt my new Brown Belt tonight ?  Alright , take an inside sleeve grip with it . ... And , go ahead and grip my gi , .. normally . Darren . ... Now with the Hanemakikomi , ... you know how Makikomi , the springing hip works ? ... You jerk em up to you onto your chest ? .. Mhm . .. Pivot , ... FALL And then spring em out . Ow . Fuck . ... With their thigh . .. I mean wi- -- ... with their thigh , Put your ankles together Darren , .. thigh , Nope . and uh .. calf . Hunh ? ...   ankles together ? Um , actually in this case , .. this to that , .. don't do it . .. I don't recommend it . ...  .. We try not . We have a little rank . W- only White Belts do that Darren . That's okay .  Well ,  I don't know what the hell I'm doing . ... Okay . Okay . ... This w- this time you won't get a chance to . .. It's gonna be a lot faster isn't it . ... Well , yes and , you're gonna be carrying the weight of both of us when you're on your heels . Oh okay . ... Alright . Now w- -- Just relax . I'm not gonna hurt you at all . ... Uh , ... when I do the Mak- -- uh the Hanegoshi , ... instead of pulling him all the way up ? ... Like this , I'm gonna come , ... and let go with this hand . ... With my right hand , I'm gonna wrap his ... right arm up . Like so . Just like this . ... Just like you would in a regular , .. Sodemakikomi . ... Then I'm gonna slam this leg up , FALL and let fly . Interesting . ... There's not much difference , I mean , .. it's a little more dynamic , ... and it's good , ... when you catch a bent-over opponent . .. Out there in shiai . .. .. Or randori . ... No need to fix your gi right now . ... It's gonna get messed up . .. Bend over for me Darren , ... No not -- Yeah . Bend over like a- -- Grab my gi . ... Alright ? From right here , ... then I come , ... FALL I'm doing a -- .. Pardon me . ... Let me go back to Hanemakikomi , I'm doing Sode . ... Bend over . ... I'm just gonna kinda scoop his arms up . ... Bring it across , ... FALL ... Notice how high I get up into his crotch with that foot ? ... That gives me more lift to him . ... Uh ... bow . ... Come here . ... Bend over . ... I've got my , .. my high collar grip on , on a bent-over player . .. Who likes to watch my feet and mess around . I'm gonna give him something to watch now . ... I'm gonna come all the way around here , ... and as I've got him wrapped up , I'm wrapping up tight , aren't I Bill . ... Yep , I'm gonna slam that up . (GRUNT) , .. FALL ... I'm gonna come all the way around on him . ... See it's okay if I get this foot , ... all the way up into the side of his crotch . ... I want to really get that lift . ... As I get that lift , ... I wanna get that outer winding pull . That Makikomi . ... Okay ? ... Let's give it a try . ... Bill I wanna see you throw Darren . We need to practice Darren's Ukemi . ...   I love it , the only Hebrew I've ever seen make the sign of the cross .  ... It takes too long to do the sign of star of David Nick None . Hush .  .. Sammy Davis Junior used to do it just fine . ... Hajime . ... Na- -- Now you gotta let go with the right hand Bill . ... Get going , wrap around . ... There , ... pull . Pull , outer winding pull . ... FALL ... And don't elbow me in the face . .. Ya- -- You need to let him have a chance to slap . That's good etiquette . ... You're right . ... Watch Bill . ... From here , ... come all the way around , Okay , ... to here . See how I got him up on that one leg ? Gotta keep that on . Okay . Then I'm gonna kick his leg up . FALL .. Boom . ... In a Hanegoshi . That spring hip . With an outer winding pull . ... It's okay if you hit it low , .. but if he's bent over , ... you can- -- and you hit it low , you're not gonna hit nothing . ... From here , ... I don't have -- I have too much distance between us . ... But from here , ... FALL ... I get more of a spring off with it . .... It's gonna be hard not to call it an ippon . Mhm . ... And even if they don't , ... I'm going right into Udegarami . ... Go . ... FALL .. Not bad ? ... Lug , you wanna give it a try ? ... Try it on Bill . ... You're in front of a Black Belt . ...  where  he can see if he wants to . Oh -- I'm sorry . ... Alright ,  ... Gotta pull going this way . ... Okay . .. I need to have him here , Jerk him . .. You don't have to g- wrap both arms up ? ... Just one really , ... jerk him around , Okay , ..  and then spring the hip up . Spring your hip . ... Take a high collar grip Lug , if he's bent over that far , ... you wouldn't start off like that . Now . .. You can just swing all the way around , and grab that arm . Okay , ... Just -- ... No , ... There's no such thing as a Haneuchimata . ... You fall straight on your face . ... Oh . ... Alright , .. you don't have the outer pull .. going for you . ... You ... still don't have enough outer pull . ... He oughtta be wound up on his tiptoes . .. Way out to here . Now spring your hip . Okay , ... Spring your hip . FALL There . ... It's hard too , ... for you , w- your legs are so short , and he's so tall . ... Try it again . ... And Martin if your hip joints were okay , ... Yeah . .. He'd b- be just perfect for you to , ... okay , for one thing you're backing in . ... Okay . ... Watch . ... From here , bend over . ... CLAP From right here , ... Okay , Jock him into it , ... Mhm , I've gotta still jerk him up on his tiptoes to throw him , .. from here ? ... See that half .. half .. instep ? ... Spot the hip ? ... I'm jerking , ... I still get under him don't I . ... FALL ... Then I'm on him . ... It's hard to control that throw , ... Did you land off the mat ? .. No no . Good . ... Uchimother . Koka . ... ... Tell you what . ... Martin let's pull this down  . ... Okay . ... Alright ? ... Lug , ... Give a more upward , ... round pull . ... From here . ... Watch . I get s- -- ... best- .. best way to do it is to feel it I guess . ... Bend over . ... Alright , I'm gonna come to here , ... now I jerk up , ... first , ... then I spin around . ... Okay . ... And I'm gonna let it go , God you're heavy . ...  ... Then I'm gonna let go here , here , ... see how I got you wound up ? ... FALL Down here . ... This is not a good throw to throw Lug in . ...  ...  ... I would suggest doing this throw , ... on combatants and opponents of equal height . ... And size . Lug would be much better , ... for a Sode-makikomi , but not a Hande-maki- Hanemakikomi . Cause the Hane , ... you add that .. spring . ... Alright , I'm having to use my .. legs , ... to throw his weight . ... Instead of using ... Sodemakikomi , FALL ... and get the outside of his legs , ... and I can make that a pretty throw . ... Alright ? ... And with the Makikomi technique with it , ... you don't have , ... the Tsurikomi . ... The lifting pull . that you would normally have . You don't have your right hand to help you with it . ... All you have is an outer winding pull with the left hand . ... It's gotta go up , out , ... and around . ... Let's give it a try . ... Throw .. throw Bill again . ... ... ... Now , spring the hip . ... FALL .. That's better , Yeah . ... Much better . ... Now let's throw it again , and not have to stop , ... and think about where the foot goes . ... Now , ... Just one moment . ... The more acute .. angle , ... that that knee gets at , ... the more power w- you have with your spring from your hip joint . ... From here , ... even if I'm doing Hanegoshi . ... if I get that , .. that knee bent , at ninety degrees right here , ... well I can blast him , ... from here , ... FALL ... I've got .. a lot of spring with it . ... Also , ... lay the ... instep of the foot . ... Toes extremely wellpointed . ... To the inside , ... of his calf , .. I mean his , ... his uh ... thigh , at the bend of his knee . ... I don't care if your heel slides up into his crotch . ... For a .. a .. Hanemakikomi . ... Now , ... uh , ... Hanegoshi , ... I'd prefer that you do it a little bit different . But Hanemakikomi , ... the higher up it gets , the more spring you get . ... Yoshi . ... Is this the right ... position here ? ... Your knees need to be bent . ... Now pull . Pull pull pull , and spr- .. and spring . ... Spring . .. Okay . ... I'm just trying to get this ,  this middle position . Alright watch . ... even though he's bent over , ... I still have to get in . ... Okay . I've got to get him loaded . Look at his .. look at his heels ? ... Is his heel up ? ... Yes , ... Alright from here , ... now I've g- I'm got to be lower , come on back side of the hands . (GRUNT) .. FALL ... And then I spring him off . ... If he's bent over , ... it's extremely hard for me to get .. under him , with a standard ... Tsuri-komi grip . ... Well this way I'm just scooting my butt in there on him . ... .. It doesn't matter if I hit him , .. a little bit above my- his obi , ... with my buttocks . ... As long as , ... that leg is automatically cocking as it goes in . .. Then I'm throwing my weight straight forward . Okay . ... With that outer winding pull . ... It's allimportant . ... Jerk him around . In a big circle . ... FALL ... Okay . Everything was there but the leg . ... Bill went into Uchimata . ... I might have to have you throw Uchi-mata a couple times , so you can throw a Hanegoshi . ... Think of it , ... as a very short , ... inverted kick . ... Like that . ... You know how you can use , ... ... inverted kick ? ... Up very close range ? Mhm ? .. That's exactly what you're doing . ...  ... Kicking the inside of his thigh . ... Okay . ... This time do an inverted kick on the inside of his thigh when you do it . ... Go into it and load him up two or three times . ... Uchi-komi . ... Alright ? ... Bend your knees as you go in too . ... You're just straight and -- straight and lockkneed ? There . ... 'S better . ... Now throw . ..  ... Relax . ... Relax and throw . ... FALL Better . Better . ... You're still sliding up that leg , you're not springing it . ... Bill , let's see you throw a couple times . ... Throw me . ...  It's hot in here . ... Thank you .  Okay it was -- ... Now I'm gonna be a sucker , and watch your feet . ... This -- ... Now you're just walking in on me man , you have- you have no outer winding pull here . ... Jerk me to you . ... Hoo , there we go , I'm on my tiptoes , what are you waiting for . FALL ... Not quite far enough in . ... A little shaky , but basic , ... as long as you're getting my head , ... to where it'll clear , and , won't  my neck , you'll be doing fine . ... Make me a happy camper , ... Ah . ... here , .. an added exp- -- .. an added attraction . ... What are we gonna do now . ... I've got my hand on your hip . Whoa . .. There we go . ... That's it beau . ... Throw . ... FALL  I was gonna get that arm free  ,  Stop whispering . ... Good . Have you played a player yet ? ... One of these ? ... You will . ... Think I did . ... Jed , you've seen these , haven't you ? .. Mhm , .. Turn on in on s- with something . ... Turn in to anything . Ah . ... Can't , can you . Go into Ouchi . ... Now I'm playing you back . ...  But , Okay , you can hook that arm , ... Oh , there we go . .. Hane-makikomi now . ... FALL Ow . Alright . ... Boy that's a hard fall ,  Oh . ...  Ippon . ... , Alright , that's where Hane-makikomi comes in . ... Now , ... the traditional way to do it , ... is not all bent over . ... It's from a regular grip . ... And I'll still go , ... ... FALL ... Not a real -- Which w- that one wasn't a very clean pretty throw . ...  functional , ... Ah f- , well , it would have been better , had my leg stayed lower . ... Traditional Hane , Hane uh , Goshi leg . ... FALL There . ... That was pretty . ... But I like the Hanemakikomi , ... when it's used on a player , ... who's fighting you in that , ... extreme defensive stance . ... While he's down in a deep jigo . .. Preferably , ... with his left foot forward . ... Pressing against you with that left hand . ... Keeping you out . ... Doing this number . ... Goes in , see he's already eliminated this place , ...  All you have to do is jerk me around to it and come to me . From there . ... Jerk , ... Hook , ... And then spring me right there . ... That's it . ... Alright , practice it on Darren a couple times . I wanna see it . ... Think if you tried the throw ? ... None Okay None . Can you tell ? ... On Darren . ... Lug's a little bit heavy for you . Where is he- -- .. Here it is . ... Don't throw him off the mat now Bill . Do we wanna do it using -- 2.. Yeah . ... Ah the only thing I -- Yeah . Take your .. position on the mat . ... All I do is  . ...  ? ... I'm keeping you out like that ? ... Well that's fine down . Are they on the chalk , Yes you are . .. Okay ? ... You gonna make   ? Throw . ... FALL ... Well , it's coming off as a winding Uchimata . Was I above your leg , ... It did ? It's not the time for uh , ... for uh .. extreme resistance yet . .. We're in practice . Okay . ... Just put your hand up there , and push a little bit . ...  , .. Not a lot of resistance from it . And , ...   . ...   . .. Thank you . .. Cause you're throwing him over toward this edge . .. Okay . ... FALL That's it . ... Pu- -- Ippon . ... Alright . ... Lug let's see you throw uh , .. throw Bill . Okay . ... Turn and bow to that Brown Belt . ... I did . ... Okay I didn't see you . Sorry . He didn't bow to me though . ... Throw , throw from there .   That would've been fine ?  ... Man that would have been as fine as frog's hair . ... Throw . ... FALL Nice winding Uchimata . ... The o- the only way that you're gonna get it Lug , ... is to keep .. practicing it . ... Alright , ... now , ... hook the arm , ... hook the arm here . ... All the way , ... and just shoot this on across . Release his head , and shoot the arm , straight through . ... Now go . Throw . ... Throw . ... FALL .. There . ... You're still shooting up , .. with a bit of a uh , ... Uchimata . ... Now I'm gonna throw him with left side . Here . ... It doesn't matter , you can keep your right hand grip . ... Alright , now I'm just gon- .. gonna shoot it to here . nan ... Now I'm coming in with my knees bent ? ... Yeah but that makes -- I've got him up , Yeah but an elbow in my f- None -- ... Don't worry about it son , I'm not going to hurt you . I'm just doing Komi . ... And from the right hand side . ... Bend over . .. Put your hand against my hip . ... Hold me out . ... Okay , .. Alright from here , he's holding me out . I just come , ... just like this . See how I shoot this hand down ? ... I don't have to try to grab him around the head . .. I shoot this hand down and I , I'm gonna follow it . ... With this shoulder . ... FALL ... All I'm doing is my , my roll out then . ... Then I've got him all locked up , now I'm .. good and tight against your chest Darren ? ... Uh , are you , yeah . .. Well , ... Am I tight against your chest . Yes , I'm right against your chest . No space between us . ... One of the secrets about making this throw work . ... Bend over Bill , ... put your hand there . ... Alright from here , ... I'm gonna roll it around here . ... See how I got my chest ? ... Have I got your chest Bill ? Yep , But my butt is in it , that's okay . (GRUNT) FALL .. Oh , Doesn't matter . ...   ... Textbook . I think about ninety percent of your problem , ... is the , ...  ... legs . ... Try it on me . ... Up now . ... nan ... Alright I'm right here . ... S- get over here . ... Alright Lug , ... swing that arm out of your way . ... Swing it all the way around . ... That's fine , see I'm getting my arm out , trying to step over now . I think you're going to go , and do , ... uh , .. a m- -- ... a uh , .. Sodemakikomi . .. This is just what it feels like from this position . ... So I'm gonna get ready to step over . ... Okay . to get away from that Sodemakikomi , I wanna step , so I can drop you with Taniotoshi . Right , ... And just as I get ready to step from here , ... kick that leg in . ... FALL  ... There I go . ... Alright come here Bill , ... Watch it Darren , ... I mean uh , ... Benton . ... Alright , ... tell me if this , .. you know , ... Sodemakikomi ? ... Now -- Ah , there we go , ... there we go , .. no , just .. don't counter , just step over the damn thing . There . .. Alright now , he stepped over , so , FALL .. I can finish up , with a Hanemakikomi . ... He off mat ? ... No . he just .. hit his hand . ... Oh , back of his hand again ,    ...  ... I guess since he's off the mat , he didn't wanna hurt his ... arms . Yeah . ... He's used to wearing a watch , try and protect it . ... Come throw him a little bit Benton . ... There , ... Now th , shoot that leg , ... shoot it now . ... Ha . ... You had a perfect position with the foot . ...  . ... Jed , can you add anything , cause I'm out here on the , Yes . .. in the front , I can't see what's going on , you're out here , right here on the side . ...   .. I've noticed something that your sensei is doing that you're not doing . ... He's reaching for the mat . ... He's in there and winds up , Yeah , ... he's reaching for the mat , ... with this arm . .. And your arm's way up here high . You're like way up high off the ground , ... and your sensei , is way down like this . By the time he gets to the end of the throw . ... See the difference ? ... So you're wrapping , and you're thinking , I gotta make this throw , what am I gonna do , ... and ... Nick , is going for the mat with this arm . He's into a f , almost like a forward roll .. mode . ... The other difference that I noticed between you and your sensei is that , ... this foot is way out here . .. This .. the , ... your , ... Are they trying to throw over the entire hip section ? with th- -- Mhm , .. And and and and , when Nick throws it , ... so pretty like he does , he's got the , his foot , much closer to the middle , .. of his opponent's center of gravity . Kay , .. S- you're so wide that , if you lift up , when you lift up to make the springing motion , ... what happens is , you fall this way real quick . ... That is it . And you don't have , ... enough to go like that . ... Try it one time . ... Reach for the ground with your ... wrapping ... arm , ... Uh uh uh -- (GRUNT) FALL Better there , .. Yeah . It's better . Reach , But , Reach , reach way into the ground with this one .  Here here here's -- it's right here .  Reach None way like this . Like you were doing a front roll out .  ... And .. and stand on this foot , so that you , ... are more balanced . ... Just a little bit more , but you- you're going down . I mean , Step in when you have his b , right between his legs . ... No step deeper . Won't settle . .. Step deeper . .. Okay , ... Look how d- -- ... Now . ... Get your foot over here . Bit more , Step right between his legs . .. That foot . ... Now , shoot your arm and , and kick . .. Oh . None Ho , Hane-maki None . None Woo None . .. Ah so . ... .. Try it again . ... Alright , you notice the difference in the foot position , what- hi- -- what -- how much that helped ? .. Mhm , ... Step directly between his legs , with your advancing foot . ... No no no no no . Ah , You're not , .. not between his legs . Now reach that arm . Reach that arm , Shoot it . Reach that arm through . .. FALL ... The more you reach that arm through , ... L- let me add one- -- Let me add one thing to it , to make it -- cause it is a hard fall if you're , throwing it contest style , if you're throwing it demo style , somebody once told me , that that , the way to practice , all the Makikomiwaza , ... was .. to go down ... like this . To take this foot if you're throwing right-hand throws , and to take this foot , and stick it all the way through like this . Yep , ... And just stick it . ... All the way , behind you , .. like this . And as you go down , ... and you roll like that . Okay , and if you do this , in demo , .. uh .. in demo fashion , you'll be so low to the ground , by the time that your opponent ... hits the ground , that you'll be real nice to him . ... And that way I mean , you can intensify , you can always intensify throwing . .. throw it harder .  But the mark of a ... good .. judo throw , is to be able to , do you see the people throw Seoi so nice , they can do -- they could throw their grandmother , and it doesn't even hurt . She goes ah . That felt good . ... So you can do that , Mm , .. by sticking that leg , ... all the way through , just like that . As you get -- .. ... You follow what I'm saying ? ... Yes sir , ... You don't have to drive em through the mat . That , that's a way that you can , practice it over and over , in a demo style , and be so low to the ground , that it's a real nice , it's about as good as you can get a Makikomi for your uke . ... It's really not that bad . And you could -- it's it's -- Throw him , and .. let him see . Alright , ... Alright , S- so we're coming over like this , ... coming in like this , ... FALL ... alright ? Nice easy clean fall . Look how tight he is to my chest ? ... Look at his body position right here . ... There is no -- ... You couldn't slide a postcard between us . ... I don't think you'd even do it between the hip- -- to- to- get the hips . ... Well do you wanna do one more ? .. Yeah , show him again . ... Here's a nice place to put my shoes . Yeah there it is . ... Mom look . Unhunh what . Look at my shoes . ...  They look like the phantom stairsteppers . Hunh . ... Nono , it looks like the Invisible Man . It does look like the Invisible Man . ... Oh-ho burp . That felt good . Wasn't there a guy called the Invisible Man ? Yes there was . ... Was he in a movie ? .. Yes he was . ... What was it called . ... The Invisible Man . ...   It was kind of a show kinda like The Shadow was . You know it was a , ... Actually though , I think they made a remake of it , with Chevy Chase , that was really lousy though . .. Steven . You know what you could do , that would be just .. really helpful ? ... Say it . ..  You could p- take these Coke cans , ... and put them in the bag full of Coke cans that are in your bedroom , ... and then we can do can squish . And squish em . For the recycling bin . ... Okay ? Tomorrow please , my feet are hurting . Tomorrow ? ... Well can you just put em in the bag , ... in there for now , okay ? ... Okay . Cause I gotta clean up in here , this .. place is just totally trashed , .. cause I've done nothing this week but , ... study and be sick . ... I've got a really bad dental problem . Or something with my mouth . ... Poor Mom . Think I've got a .. sinus infection or something . Don't Steven . ... Mmkay . Please . I know it's tempting . ...

It's a getting to be old . ... You did bring the gifts ? ... I did bring the gifts . . ... I got a story to tell you , it's a shaggy dog story , but as long as we're talking about that recorder and six-hundred dollars ,  I'll tell you the story ,  oh gosh , uh , Rae and I and Sue and Buddy , ... took a trip , ... to Mexico City , ... It must've been , ... four to six months after my dad died . That's how I remember it , he died in s -- Oh God . ... December sixtyseven , so ,  sometime in sixty-eight we took this trip , we'd been ... talking about it for a while , ... uh , flew down to Mexico City , ... uh we , c- think of the name of my hotel , which wouldn't mean anything now , but we ended up in a ... fabulous hotel , ... uh , ... first night , we were very unhappy with our rooms , we got down there ,  and the next morning , Buddy , who's a ... early riser anyhow , was probably up ... four o'clock , and he went down there complaining to the manager , ... So , .. cause it was not w- the accommodation we were supposed to have had , we checked in about eight o'clock at night or so , which is ,  in Mexico is like , .. you know , ... the -- ... Well we ended up with a .. corner .. suite . ... With ... It was so big , ...  we could've had a party for fifty people  . Three bathrooms in it , ... two bedrooms , so they had , but they had an extra guest bathroom  , .. big bar , ... it was circ , open on two sides , of course we didn't have anybody there but the two of us , ... And I remember the New York Yankees were ... training there . So it probably was , the season opens in .. April , so it probably was February or March , ... Mickey Mantle , and uh Whitey Ford and all of em , ... I wish I'd ... been art enough .. to know then that uh , these baseball cards , and those .. autographs , would be selling for , ... three or four hundred dollars ,  but , .. at any rate , uh , ... I went down there with a recorder . ... We used to -- ... We had those ... things at the store , ... that we used to use , ... when we'd go out of town and , (SNIFF) particularly if we were looking at some site , ... or , we were looking at a store , (SNIFF) when we had some comments , we'd talk into those things . ... We had ... four or five of em , Aaron had one , I had one , .. Mike had one ,  had one , from that financial guy , ... Things .. sold at the time for about eight or nine-hundred dollars . ... Eight or ninehundred ? Eight- -- Eight or nine-hundred dollars . (SNIFF) ... Uh , ... you got a very sophisticated one , but you know the little ones now about this size . Well this son of a bitch weighed about fifteen pounds . It was some .. heavy son of a bitch . .. .. Had a pouch , like , sorta like you've got . I carried it around . Well any rate , ... my wife had fallen in love , ... with a , ... Mexican artist by the name of ... Nierman . ... Forgot his first name . Jewish guy . ... Mm . Mexican national . ... His paintings sold , ... f- for ... generally , ... a thousand dollars plus . ... Which was , .. for me , ... A lotta money in those days . Twenty-five years ago , ... I was -- no way I was gonna spend twe- a thou- -- First of all I didn't like him . .. Very splashy . ... Albert and Marcia had one of his paintings ,  ... they had -- ... They had -- ... I I don't know , Marcia had a relative in Mexico , or something . But they'd been down there . ... Many times and , ... and they had his book , ... and , ... we got down there , and he was , .. uh , ... all over the place . His paintings were , he lived in Mexico City . ... ... And uh , ... we had a ... cab driver . ... Uh , that was gonna take us to , ... wherever the place where the gold was . I can't remember , one of the roughest rides , and if you ever been to Mexico City , you made that ride , Yeah .  some kinda city , about .. hundred miles away , I thought we were gonna die going down there . An old car and , .. anyway .  .. Well before that , he took us .. around the city , ... still got his card somewhere . .. Slammed the damn door on this guy , poor guy's hand one day , inadvertently , we were getting out , we had him about three days ,  one day we took him down to ... wherever we went , ... Buddy and Sue didn't go , ... but he .. took us to the ruins , and all that stuff . You know ,  .. uh , ... you know , I and I I knew .. then , and I know now , that those guys , ... take you to a particular place , they get a commission . ... Well , ... they took us to this guy's studio . ... He what ? Took us to this guy- .. artist's studio . ... Uh , ... and uh , ... Rae , ... he was there . ... And she saw a painting she liked . ... And , ... uh , he wanted that damn ... recorder . ... And he said I tell you what I'll do . ..  .. make you a deal . He said I'll -- ... You take this painting , ... I want that recorder . I'll take it . ... Could- -- naw I can't do that , it's not mine . ... It was -- ... It's about a thousand dollar swap . ... Shit I thought my wife was gonna have a fit ,  she was pissed off , Mexico City was a , uh in those days , .. probably still is , ... not -- ... For this guy he was very successful . ... Uh , ... very prolific . But it was an art colony , and there were a lot of Americans down there . He was not an American . ... A lot of Americans down there , ... uh because , ... cost of living was so cheap at the time . And they- they had these ... art shows everywhere . ... Well we bought a painting , ... uh , .. of a little Mexican woman , ... still got it , with a watermelon on her head , like it a lot . .. Think I paid ... thirty dollars for it . Well that was about my price range . ... Uh , ... while I was down there , we ... may have bought a couple of other i- inexpensive paintings , maybe .. collectively we bought , ... maybe spent a hundred and fifty dollars .  Uh , hell I was not an art -- We weren't art collectors . ... And uh , to spend a thousand dollars , to me for a painting , was unthinkable . ... ... Uh , ... The s- first painting I ever bought , my father-in-law bought it from Geri f , ... Geri Rae , ... it was one of Geri's original early .. early paintings , which I thoroughly enjoy , she's changed styles but ,  While we were down there , ... uh , ... You know I , This -- It -- I've seen that somewhere before . ... You know I've had that painting for ... thirty-five years I guess . I- I've never framed it . .. And I really like it . ... Uh , my -- ... My .. my father-in-law wanted to give me a painting for my -- Piece of art for my office . And so I had a -- ... We had a ... display guy at the time , by the name of Ben Money , ... fashioned himself as an artist . ... And I said Ben , ... pick me out something . You've got fifty bucks to spend . ... So , .. he got this from Geri , ... and I loved it . ...  , It's beautiful . And and , .. I can see all kinda things in it , It's got a lotta color and , Lotta color . I see a Chinese junk , At any rate , .. to make a long s- -- ... This fellow LeRoy Neiman , ... over here . .. Sports artist . ... Not the same guy , ... as this guy .. Nierman . I've forgotten his name . .. Oh I thought there was a connection . ... No . No connection . K- there is a connection on the story , ... Well , ... we looked at a lot of art , in in in the , .. in the , uh parks , and there at least it was , ... pleasant weather and , ... Like .. that .. uh , ... It was sorta like , ... uh , ... What the hell they call the district in New York , where on Sunday , they put all the artists , .. put their paintings out , uh , the Village , the Village . The Village . ... You know all the all these artists put their -- Well they had , ... must've had three areas like that . Parks with paintings , and my god , there must've been thousands of paintings . ... And uh , .. most of em , ... very inexpensive . Uh starving artists that were down there , lots of American . .. ... Well , ... uh , ... we wandered around down in the , the area which , I've forgotten the area that they called , ... in Mexico City where , ... uh , ... most of the jewelry shops are and things . ... It's got a name . I can't remember , I've never been back . ... They also had a lot of , ... uh , ... artist .. galleries down there . ... And I walked into this gallery , .. during one of our -- ... We were down there maybe ten days . ... And I saw this guy Nierman . I never heard of him , ... at that time . He he .. he got famous at the nineteen , ... uh , ... probably seventy-two Olympics . .. Uh , ... but his c- -- His art was already in collections of guys like Edward gee Robinson , it was very popular in Hollywood . ... He also was very prolific . .. Big ... handlebar mustache . ... And I walked in , ... and there must have been about , ... twelve or fifteen paintings in there . ...  They were , ... uh , ... You walked into his studio , or , ... It was a gallery . ... Uh , he didn't live there . he didn't live in Mexico . Okay . The oth- th- -- The guy n- -- Th- the Jewish fellow , they're both Jewish . Okay . Th- th- this guy Nierman , .. who was a Mexican national , lived there . Okay . ... Forgotten his first name . Leonardo Nierman or something . But any rate , but uh , this guy's name was LeRoy .. Neiman , I'd never heard of him , well I'd .. heard of Nierman . Uh , because Rae went down there wanting to buy one of those paintings . These were paintings , which I'd say were about the size of this Joe Namath . ... there . .. Which is a seriograph . ... And , .. we went in , and uh , ... they were just back from Acapulco , ... season was just over in Acapulco . ... And he had about ... fifteen ... twenty paintings , twenty-five paintings , ... football players , horse races , ... that's what he did , they were .. about that size . ... I'd been in there , ... oh God I looked at em , they just struck me as something , I loved em . They were great . They were you know very -- Had a very distinctive style . ... And , .. uh , .. the guy said uh , ... God you've been in here , ... so many times that , said I'll make you a deal . ... You pick out any four of these you want , I'll give em to you for five-hundred dollars . ... The four of em . ... Shit , I loved those things . I stewed on those son of bitches , stewed on those son of bitches , I figured , I bought those fucking paintings , I'd have to buy that damn thing for Rae , ..  or , I'd trade that camera for a thousand dollars , and nine-hundred dollars to buy another one , ... I promise you as God is my witness . ... This guy's originals sell for a hundred thousand dollars apiece or more . ... You are kidding . They were . ... He is , ... big , ... big , He's the premiere sports artist in the world . Really . ... And ... uh , ... I'd never heard of him . ... And , but of course the price was right for me , but I didn't buy em . ... That was about- -- That was about nineteen -- Spring of sixtyeight . .. And I was watching the Olympics , ... of ... nineteenseventytwo . ... And he'd been engaged by the Olympic committee . ... Uh he was .. prominent then , but not ... world famous . ... (SNIFF) And uh , ... I -- ... He was up ... all over . ... He's got a great big bull of -- ... Bull Moose moustache sort of a deal , General Bull Moose if you remember . Yep . And .. uh , ... his art was so distinctive . And he's -- The sketching . ... I said Jesus . That's my man . ... I remember seeing at the Olympics . .. I hollered and screamed , and I told the story , Well of course , ... since that time , ... I'm on his mailing list , ...  ...  ..   , one main gallery in New York , ... that uh , think distributes for him around the United States , and I'm on the mailing list , ... and they get today , ... twenty-five hundred to twenty-seven-fifty for .. a seriograph . ... Of which he produces maybe ... three to five-hundred of em . .. Depending on the issue . But these were originals . ... I- -- Jon I promise you as God as my witness . .. I -- ... He was -- I could've walked away with those things and -- .. And .. uh , ... I I I p- -- ... -- But that's my story on that machine . ... That damn thing , and of course , ... I didn't know , Obviously I didn't know what I was missing , if I'd done I'd done that   .  Obviously . But you know ,  It was -- But still five-hundred dollars was a lot of money in those- -- .. Five-hundred dollars was -- You didn't spend that much on the whole trip probably . Oh hell I w- I , you know I w- I , I would s- I would say probably , ... certainly we didn't spend five-hundred dollars for , uh , ... for , ... novelties and things of that nature , you know it was -- You tal- you talking about a long time ago . Mexico City was cheap . Jesus Christ , Oh man it was -- I mean ,  We .. we we stayed in a first rate , .. I guess what you call today a four star hotel but , hell , I don't imagine we paid , ... twenty dollars , twenty-five dollars a night . ... You know  uh uh , Probably . Probably . But uh , anyhow , ... uh .. I I I -- ... God I my -- ... I give my wife the story , Every once in a while this guy's name -- Cause uh I I I .. I .. I like this guy , love him . .. Uh , and of course , ... you know I've never , ... uh , ...  ... This one over here on the right , ... although it's signed by , by n , .. Nier- -- By , by LeRoy Neiman , Paul  , ... and a uh , ... And is also signed by the artist , it was done for a , .. uh , ... Poster ? ... A benefit , it was a poster . ... That's just , That's not a , ... that's not what they call a seriograph , the Joe N , the Joe uh Namath , .. Who was of course an Alabama football player . Yeah . Yeah . is , I saw it out in San Francisco , and my , ... my .. my in-laws bought that for me , ... uh , ... but uh , ... uh , ... It's a beauty though . That's my , That th- that's my r , That's my , ... my experience with one of those machines . I didn't have enough judgment to , ... to trade him that fucking machine , To give him the machine .   because I'd say probably it wasn't , ... Like it was like computers . ... Well in a year or so after that , that thing was so impractical . .. Cause it was s , ... heavy heavy heavy . .. You , uh and , Well they -- .. it's like you say I --  Eloise gave me one for Christmas about --  This big . You know , and you buy one for , ... sixty dollars . Eighty dollars . ... I got one , I bought from Radio Shack It's --  Well did Rae ever get uh Nierman ,   ... No . ... Never did get it . ... But she nudged me when she got back , but of course , ... I guess , I haven't done it recently , but over the years I like to tell her this story .  tonight , because I haven't thought about it in a long time , And she'll say to me , I told you to get em .  I told you None . I must've gone into the place five times . You know , I'd go in there ,  and your mouth is just watering . ... Shit . If I buy those -- But you knew you were gonna have to buy her w- -- Well if I had to -- If I bought those things , ... Shit I'd have to buy her that damn thing , Oh , ain't no question . And there was no question about that , there wouldn't've been any liv- -- Wouldn't been any living with her . You know , it's uh , y- y , .. You know , ... h- I -- ... I've gotten a lot better . ... But in those days , ... you know , hell I was , ... uh , ... maybe , ... I was , ... s- see . ... Sixtyeight , seventy-eight eightyeight , ...  -- ... Just twenty-seven twenty-eight years ago . I was .. thirty-eight .. thirty-nine .. years old . ... And uh , ... I , ... I sure didn't have -- I sure wasn't prosperous . I had my damn trip budgeted . ... And uh , ... to have gone out there and spent , ... another fifteen-hundred to two-thousand dollars for artwork , ... you know , ... my mother , who was you know strong as moose meat , ... come back , ... if she'd've known , ...  She'd've figured I needed my fucking head examined .  She'd've deducted it .  ..  None Shit None . Oh . .. Any rate uh , That's a good story though . Ah it's ... TRUE story . Good story . TRUE story . .. It was a TRUE story . I I -- ... Well it would've cost you that to replace the doggone ... machine ? Aw I'd've had to replace it for the store , uh , but as I said it was only a matter of , ... I guess a year , ... those things were really antiquated . .. Although we used em a lot . Uh , in those days , ... and I , .. you know I .. recorded the whole trip , .. .. and uh , you know things that we did , ... It was a wonderful trip , we had good times , Better than keeping a diary ? Oh yeah . A lot easier . It really is . .. Uh , .. We -- .. I keep a -- Remember we tried keeping a diary on the China trip , and man it was ... arduous . Well , ... I keep a diary- -- course I .. we .. we haven't traveled much lately , I keep a diary , ... when I , ... go out of the country . ... Still got em in here . .. Otherwise , my problem is , ... and it's a lot easier to do it that way , but I , ... I keep I diary when I go out of the country , .. The problem is , ... nan with me , ... not that it comes up too much , .. but someone'll say something to me about somewhere I s , POUND .. Shit , I .. I , .. you know I , ... I forgot where I went . I have to look , cause I can't remember . Well you go to so many places , .. on a cruise particularly , you know , Yeah . ... So many places in a short time , that you get em mixed up . Now we can't even keep our photos straight without the diary . Oh yeah . Well you know , .. y- when you get back from your trip , ... until you make another trip , ... you can remember . But , having taken as many trips as you've taken , shit , they sorta run together . I'm talking about , ... They do . the ones that were five years ago , Honest they do . to separate the trip that you went on this one f- -- It's tough to do . ... And uh , ... but , ... they're a lot -- that's a lot easier than a diary , then you can transcribe it . But uh , ... I don't take , ... I don't take my diary in the domestic United States , and we haven't traveled all that much , but I have taken em , ... uh , ... first trip I made , ... .. you know , o- out , ...  , In nineteenseventysix . ...  -- Tha- -- ... Outside of ... Mexico , out of the country , was I went to , ... Uh we went to , I went to the Orient . ... On a business trip .  exploratory trip , I was there for ... fifteen days , worked my ass off . ... But it was uh , went to uh , ... Japan , went to Osaka , which was the textile city , ... and then uh , ... Taipei and Hong Kong . Uh , and it was a , You've been . ... Um but it was for me , ... uh , ... uh not only an education , we'd been doing some importing , ... but uh through , ... a group . ... And it was a group of us that went . I guess it probably was , ... a dozen in our group that went . ... There was a group of stores that we were associated with , .. it was a .. a .. an interesting trip , uh , ... very educational . ... Uh , ... still got my notes from nineteen-seventy-six but , .. s- .. and all those god damn cards , you know how they get over there , everybody gives you ,  .. gives you , Yeah . .. gives you a card . ... I'll never forget how impressed I was with , of all the Orientals , the Japanese are so bright . My god . .. And uh just uh , ... uh ... uh , ... Catch PING on like that PING . They jus- -- Don't they . Oh . ... They really they -- .. they really they real- they really , They work at though man , and the Chinese work at it . They're good students , You know , Well yeah . ... well , you know , we see , Listen , look at these .. people from India . What s- good students they are . Some of your fine doctors , It's amazing ain't it . yeah . You know we see these people , you know y- -- ... You know we've talked about this , ... on groups for years , .. all the problems we got with the Blacks , I was just reading an article , ... I believe it was the paper this morning . ... Where I read it . Maybe it was New York Times yesterday . ... Thirty-three percent , ... of the Black ... juveniles in their twenties , ... are either in jail ,    ... on parole , ... or just released . ... Thirty-three percent . ... And then I , I read .. in another art- -- And .. that doesn't count how many got away . .. Oh that's right . ... But that's of the -- ... in their twenties . ... I read an article , .. within the last three or four months , ... and I'm , I believe I'm correct on this figure that , ... twelve percent of the Black male population of the United States is POUNDING in prison . ... Twelve percent POUNDING . ... Of the Black male population . As you say , how many di- -- You know , how many oughta be in jail , ... probably that many more . .. But the point I was gonna make is , ... and there're always exceptions . ... Uh .. not to take anything away from uh , ... Percy Jones . Whose article I read this morning . .. because I mean he's , I don't know , .. what his family had , but I mean he's , .. you know he's , he's c- he's .. he's , ... come out of it . ... But , ... by and large across the board , POUND ... nan , ... .. they've just never educated themselves . Coming from these backgrounds ,  Well that's the hard part . and .. and yet you s- -- they haven't educated themselves . And you see these people come here from POUNDING Taiwan , ... Korea , .. Cambodia POUNDING , ... Taipei , ... parents can't speak English , they come over not speaking English , .. and they , they excel .. scholastically , in the most difficult subjects . I mean chemistry , physics , .. medicine . .. I remember one year , ... there for at the time I remember reading the article , it's been ten or twelve years ago , but fourteen , were . Fourteen , ... uh ... public ... and private ... high schools in ShreveportBos . I don't know how many there are today . I remember that , ... it was a big article , that five valedictorians . ... For ... shjust ShreveportBossier . ... Five valedictorians that year were of Oriental descent . .. You know , couldn't've been at that time , (SNIFF) ... two hundred and fifty families in the whole damn area . No . ... Uh , ..  You know and you think -- You know um , and you think about the Jews , the Irish , and the Blacks , and it's the same .. all over the fucking world . Mm . And I just read an article in New York Times . ... Yesterday . I clipped it For my wife to read . ..  Uh , ... about the fact ... that , ... in Israel , ... where they have brought in , ... thirtythousand , ... where do the dark ones come from , .. Ethiopia . Ethiopia . .. Uh , ... and five-hundred-thousand Russians . .. Ha- .. very proud of the fact .. that they've been able to do this , in a country of five million people . Uh , ... which , ... would devastate most countries . I mean they , ... uh , It's ten percent . ... the , ... and and the , the Ethiopians in particular , had a big march last week . Because they're second-class citizens . The Jews look down on them too .
